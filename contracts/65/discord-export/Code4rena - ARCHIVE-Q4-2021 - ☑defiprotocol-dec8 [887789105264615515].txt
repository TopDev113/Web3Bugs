Curious how awards are given out? This was my first contest


[24-Sep-21 09:08 AM] sockdrawermoney#0001
@Joey | Tribe (1+1=3) it takes a bit cos our process looks like this:
1. Contest finishes
2. Sponsor reviews and identifies duplicate findings and leaves comments for the judge
3. An impartial judge reviews all findings and scores them for severity and validity
4. We calculate the results based on the judge’s assessment


[24-Sep-21 09:09 AM] sockdrawermoney#0001
We are getting faster but it’s still a bit of an intense process.


[24-Sep-21 09:09 AM] Joey | Tribe (1+1=3)#1111
Sure no rush just wanted to get a sense for how it normally goes


[24-Sep-21 09:10 AM] sockdrawermoney#0001
Y’all submitted a record of 260-some findings on this one. 😅 A typical decent turnout is ~80-120 submissions

are the results announced for this?


[29-Nov-21 07:10 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Not just yet.  There were a record number of findings submitted for the first round. Both contests are currently being judged.


[05-Dec-21 05:59 PM] itsmeSTYJ#4682
Any updates on this? I noticed that there is another contest for defiProtocol but the previous results are not out yet.


[06-Dec-21 06:05 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
The first two contests are still in the process of being judged.

Got it, thanks for the update. Any idea why judging is taking so long for these contests? 

The turnaround time for contests really vary a lot haha


[06-Dec-21 06:11 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
We are working to streamline a few of our processes to improve the overall turnaround time for contests.

Hi @frank-beard I would love to know in what way is your project different from set protocol ? Thks


[09-Dec-21 08:09 AM] frank-beard#8353
it is similar, being an asset managament/index creation protocol, but this project is much simpler, and uses an auction system to rebalance vs integrating directly with dexes like Set


[09-Dec-21 09:08 AM] Pedroais#1630
Thank you !
