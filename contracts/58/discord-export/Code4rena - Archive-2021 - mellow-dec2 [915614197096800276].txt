Hi @0xn1ck I am encountering/troubleshooting various errors with the brownie tests, hardhat tests, and hardhat coverage scripts in the provided repo. Can you confirm these were all working on your end in the state deployed?


[03-Dec-21 06:29 PM] sirhashalot#3882
The problem could easily be my environment, but I wanted to check. To give one example of one of these errors, I've encountered this 'getContract' one in a few places:          test/GatewayVault.test.ts:126:52 - error TS2551: Property 'getContract' does not exist on type 'typeof import("/2021-12-mellow/mellow-vaults/node_modules/ethers/lib/ethers") & HardhatEthersHelpers'. Did you mean 'getContractAt'?          line 126:    const vaultRegistry = await ethers.getContract("VaultRegistry");

We are sure that tests had been working. CI shows that. 
Are you using `yarn` not `npm` ?


[06-Dec-21 07:58 AM] mihanix#8699
Though it should be `getContractAt` instead of `getContract` , thanks for that
