Hey @Splidge just wanted to ask if there are gas opt rewards (either token/USDC)


[20-Aug-21 07:35 AM] Splidge#7211
I'll have to pass this one on to @Andrew | Reality Cards 🎴 as I wasn't involved in the financial side of this contest.

is there a github diff of your changes from the previous contest? Did you implement new features?


[20-Aug-21 07:44 AM] Andrew | Reality Cards 🎴#4617
@qedk good question, sorry but we are not allocating any of the pot for gas optimisation. The logic being that we are so close to launch, that we are very keen not to make a single change to the contracts unless it is 100% necessary, lest we introduce some new issue somehow!


[20-Aug-21 07:51 AM] qedk#7335
Ah no worries, just submitted one anyway

Can anyone help with a noob question? When I try to run tests im getting ‘contract is not defined’


[22-Aug-21 03:13 AM] Splidge#7211
Maybe it's because we are using hardhat not truffle for the tests? Have you tried `npx hardhat test` ?

Hi, I'm curious why a while loop is needed when performing `_searchOrderbook` in the `_updateBidInOrderbook` function when the `_prevUser` parameter should already tell you where to insert the new bid?


[23-Aug-21 01:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
I also want to check re. the linked list used in RCOrderBook.sol. Is the further you are in the linked list, the higher your price? or is it the reverse?


[23-Aug-21 02:22 AM] Splidge#7211
It could be that multiple users place bids at the same (or similar) times. Lets say that Alice is the current owner, Bob and Carol both place bids at the same time, Both Bob and Carol would pass the starting location "Alice", if we didn't search at all then it would depend on the order of processing if Bob or Carol succeeds, either-way one of them would fail.
By allowing searching we remove some of the issues around transaction processing times.
We have considered not needing the starting location at all, in a previous version it was so gas intensive to search the orderbook the starting location was required to be within 10 positions otherwise it would fail. However now we can search 1000+ positions it's probably not necessary to do this anymore (a bid that far down the orderbook would be very unlikely to ever be used), we simply haven't removed it because we can't be sure if this will be required or not in the future.

Starting with the market record the `.next` bid is the current owner of the card, the highest priced bid (if it exists, otherwise it points back at the market record). 
Then going `.next` each time the price of the bids decreases eventually arriving back at the market record. 
So the further you are down the list the lower your price.
I suppose a version could be made where the list might not need to be doubly linked and `.prev` could be removed, although we'll not be making that change before launch, maybe for V2.
The Leaderboard is very similar, with the first record being the user with the longest time held, then the `.next` user has less time held etc etc. I did accidentally have this backwards for a while but it didn't matter because the position in the Leaderboard doesn't matter, only if you're on it or not.

Is anyone from reality cards online atm? I have a quick question about a function.


[25-Aug-21 01:53 AM] Splidge#7211
Sorry we are in a European timezone so didn't see this. I'll be around for the next 10 or so hours.
