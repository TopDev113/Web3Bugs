Hi there!


[19-Jan-22 11:03 PM] StErMi.eth#0277
from the description I didn't understand which is the commit from which I should start the audit, could you clarify?


[19-Jan-22 11:22 PM] StErMi.eth#0277
if it's possible:

- point us to the correct github snapshot from which we should do the audit
- be more specific on area of concerns because I don't understand if all the "audit fixes" and the "PR" are already in the snapshot we need to review or if we need to jump from one snapshot to another (that would be an hell of a task)
- if ShareBuy and SherClaim are correctly included (or at least the version we should audit) in the snapshot
- is the V2 already in mainnet? I need to know that to understand if some more finding can be proposed or not

Hi
- The readme contains the following sentence "Code can also be viewed at https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-core @ 25b0897c236a" does that answer your first question? 
- "Audit fixes" and "PR" are in the snapshot, I threw in some commit hashes so it's possible for Wardens to view the diff between the audit commit hash and the current code base for example `git diff 25b0897c236a..8ae51c5a2ec`.  (on the sherlock-v2-core repo)
- Yes the code in the repo is the correct snapshot.
- No it's not on mainnet 🙂

In what way is aave yield distributed to stakers ?


[20-Jan-22 08:35 PM] Kenzo Agada#5926
My VScode doesn't recognize Sherlock's function definitions - I can't ctrl+click a function to go to it / do "go to definition". It happened in some other projects before. Anybody knows what am I missing / how to fix it?

[20-Jan-22 09:13 PM] Kenzo Agada#5926
Hmm... I get the problem on Sherlock.sol but not on SherlockProtocolManager.sol


[21-Jan-22 10:15 AM] Pedroais#1630
I always get that problem at random. Sometimes I close and open vscode and it works.

Yeah I was also annoyed by this, so I spent some time. It seems to be a parser error for empty try-blocks (line 286). Just add some dummy command and it should work


[21-Jan-22 03:53 PM] RamiRond#1730
The bug should be located in this repo if someone wants to fix it 😄

~~any eta on when https://www.sherlock.xyz/ is gonna be up?(or is it just me that has issues with it)~~

Hi, I'm curious about this line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/managers/AaveV2Strategy.sol#L93. So, why not check _amount == 0?

[23-Jan-22 07:11 PM] Evert Kors#2684
Hey good question, and thanks for pointing out I need to clarify that comment lol. Basically `== 0` is already checked for in the preceding call in Sherlock.sol. This check ensures that it doesn't execute a `withdrawAll()` call (AAVE uses uint256.max as a magic number to withdraw max)


[23-Jan-22 08:04 PM] wuwe1#3707
Cool, thank you.
