# Core Contract

Core contract, written in Vyper & Solidity.

## Compile & Deploy

```bash
brownie compile
```

```bash
brownie run deploy
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
brownie test
```

The unit tests included in this mix are very generic and should work with any ERC20 compliant smart contract. To use them in your own project, all you must do is modify the deployment logic in the [`tests/conftest.py::token`](tests/conftest.py) fixture.

## Resources
