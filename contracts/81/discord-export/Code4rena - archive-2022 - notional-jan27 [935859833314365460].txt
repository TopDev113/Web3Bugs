What is the consideration of doing this manual decode instead of doing abi.decode? Thanks!

I think it's quite a bit more painful to verify the correctness of this decode compared to just use abi.decode (which I see to be used pretty frequently)

seems like it is packed encode not the standard abi.encode

from: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/abi-spec.html
> Since the encoding is ambiguous, there is no decoding function.

Oh I see, thanks!

Hi, can I ask if the rewards for this contest has been distributed? I have received the rewards from elastic swap but not from this. Thanks!
