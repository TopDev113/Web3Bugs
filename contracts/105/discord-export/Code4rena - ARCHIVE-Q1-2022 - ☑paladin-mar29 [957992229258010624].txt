@Kogaroshi Why both `PaladinToken.sol` and `HolyPaladinToken.sol` have delegate function?
When only hPAL is used for voting power?


[30-Mar-22 01:50 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
Because the PaladinToken is currently live, and used for voting right now


[30-Mar-22 01:51 AM] VAD#3549
Ok so hPAL not live yet, gotcha


[30-Mar-22 01:51 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
Yep, the contest is for hPAL & the RewardReserve


[30-Mar-22 02:34 AM] sseefried#3382
@Kogaroshi What does MP stand for? Anything to do with DMs?


[30-Mar-22 02:35 AM] sseefried#3382
So `dropDecreaseDuration` is set at contract creation time but otherwise cannot be changed. How is the `HolyPaladinToken` contract  supposed to be used after this time has elapsed?


[30-Mar-22 02:38 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
Private message, used the French way to say, sorry


[30-Mar-22 02:38 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
After the decrease duration, the endDropPerSecond value will be used


[30-Mar-22 02:41 AM] sseefried#3382
I'm trying to get a sense of what hPAL will be used for in a wider sense. Are there docs that describe the overall goal of this system?


[30-Mar-22 02:42 AM] sseefried#3382
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks.


[30-Mar-22 02:42 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
It's the 1st phase of our tokenomics, to be then build upon (the Locks for example)


[30-Mar-22 02:46 AM] sseefried#3382
Do you imagine that multiple instance of this one smart contract will exist e.g. with different initial values?


[30-Mar-22 02:47 AM] Kogaroshi#1851
Not for now, no


[30-Mar-22 02:51 AM] sseefried#3382
@Kogaroshi Can you add me so we can DM/MP? 🙂


[01-Apr-22 04:55 PM] AceGawd#3787
