Can you please confirm on scope. https://code4rena.com/contests/2021-12-nftx-contest contains very few contract when compared to https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/tree/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity


[16-Dec-21 05:46 AM] Kiwi#7331
The contracts listed there are the scope


[16-Dec-21 05:22 PM] Kiwi#7331
if anyone has any questions please dont hesitate to ask or dm


[16-Dec-21 05:22 PM] Kiwi#7331
some of the tests are outdated, this has been in production for several months and we have made several modifications and additions, my apologies


[17-Dec-21 08:14 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Just for transparency, the NFTX team made some minor tweaks to the repo a few hours ago, to fix some tests that weren't working. While we usually ask for a code freeze during the contest, this felt important enough to make an exception to that rule.

@Kiwi I asked on #❓questions but maybe it was better to ask here directly. I'm new so sorry if it's a stupid question

I saw that you have many contracts that probably come from the OZ repository. I see that you have OZ in the package.json but you never use it directly in the code.

1) are those contracts copy/paste from OZ?
2) do they differ from the source code in some way?
3) is there a reason why you didn't use code from the npm package?


[18-Dec-21 01:14 AM] Kiwi#7331
Most of them are copy paste


[18-Dec-21 01:14 AM] Kiwi#7331
Why didn't I use the import, uhhh


[18-Dec-21 01:14 AM] Kiwi#7331
Idk I'm kinda a solidity boomer lol


[18-Dec-21 01:14 AM] Kiwi#7331
I studied solidity mainly 3 years ago when those imports would cause problems a lot lol


[18-Dec-21 01:15 AM] Kiwi#7331
The only different one is pausable


[18-Dec-21 01:15 AM] Kiwi#7331
Oh and we changed beacon proxy/upgradeable beacon a little


[18-Dec-21 01:16 AM] Kiwi#7331
Because it would conflict when used with a transparent upgradeable proxy


[18-Dec-21 01:36 AM] StErMi.eth#0277
gotcha thanks!


[19-Dec-21 05:25 AM] Ruhum#9483
I'd like to extend one of the issues I just reported. Found another way that issue could be exploited which I'd like to add. Could anybody help me with that? Maybe @⛅CloudEllie or @itsmetechjay | C4 ?


[20-Dec-21 06:06 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Yep you can DM me with the details. Happy to assist you.
