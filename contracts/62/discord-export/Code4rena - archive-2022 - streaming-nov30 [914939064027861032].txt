@itsmeSTYJ I can’t reply to your DM until you accept my friend request

Ah sorry fixed it!

It looks like the main contracts (Stream Factory, Stream) are not in the repository here:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/tree/main/Streaming/src  Am I looking in the wrong place?

Sent finding a second time because i made a typo and forgot to add link to code


[05-Dec-21 04:13 PM] wagyu#8255
What does the unlock=1 in the lockinternal () function denote?


[05-Dec-21 04:35 PM] holterhus#3298
That’s a common implementation of a reentrancy guard, it requires that unlock = 1 before the function call, sets unlock = 2, then sets unlock = 1 after the function call. So unlock = 1 means “unlocked” and unlock = 2 means “locked” in this sense


[05-Dec-21 05:46 PM] wagyu#8255
Thanks for the clarification


[06-Dec-21 03:39 PM] wildmolasses#7431

hey! curious as to when findings will be posted; any estimate there?


[28-Jan-22 08:36 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
The draft report is currently with the sponsor for review, but they have final say over when it's published. We always want to make sure they've had the opportunity to mitigate findings first.


[28-Jan-22 08:37 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
