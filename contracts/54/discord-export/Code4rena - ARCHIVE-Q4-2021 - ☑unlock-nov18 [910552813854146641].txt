Je ne sais pas si vous êtes francophone, mais c'est amusant pour moi de pratiquer mon français.

NOTE: there is a problem with the updated code4rena website and the unlock-contest is currently not accessible from there. 
For everyone wondering, here is the correct repo: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-unlock

Thanks @merkleplant it looks like our logo is also not correct 🙂

Thank you so much for the direct link for everyone! I think the issue with the site might be related to a cached state. Does a hard reload of this page fix it for you? https://code4rena.com/contests/2021-11-unlock-protocol-contest

People viewing the site fresh should see it correctly (phew! 🙂 ), and I'll work on hunting down the bug that caused this to happen for you

Hi, is only Unlock.sol, PublicLock.sol & UnlockDiscountTokenV2.sol in scope or everything in the repo?


[18-Nov-21 07:53 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
@julien ^^


[18-Nov-21 07:54 PM] julien#1972
Everything in the rpo but the bulk of things is in these 3 contracts 🙂
