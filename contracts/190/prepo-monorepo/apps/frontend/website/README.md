## What is this?

This is the public website: [https://prepo.io](https://prepo.io).

## How it was built

The boilerplate is built with the following stack:

- React using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as framework together with Typescript.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) for styles
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for writing and running unitests.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running the app

Please have a look at .env.sample to get started

```bash
# development
$ yarn dev

# production mode
$ yarn start
```

## Building the app (static HTML files)

```bash
# build
$ yarn build
```

This command will generate a folder `out` which will include all the static HTML files. That folder is the one that should be deployed to hosting provider

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test
```
