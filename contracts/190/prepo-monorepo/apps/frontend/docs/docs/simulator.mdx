# Simulator ðŸ§®


The first thing built for prePO was a [comprehensive SDK](/developer/sdk) with built-in market simulation capabilities.

This unlocked the door for us to build [**prePO Simulator**](https://simulator.prepo.io) - a tool for playing out different scenarios as a Trader or Liquidity Provider on prePO.


Through the Simulator, we aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of how prePO works, including the impact of different inputs and parameters.

## Scenarios

As a curious trader, you could play out a scenario where you enter a long position in a SpaceX market at a valuation of $100B and exit at a valuation of $400B, and understand what your overall profit would be if that scenario played out.

Or as an LP, you could explore the â€˜max lossâ€™ scenario if you provided liquidity for an OpenSea market, to visualize prePOâ€™s unique downside minimization for LPs and the [3 Layers of Rewards](/concepts/rewards) that can offset any potential losses.

## Advanced Mode

For the Precogs out there, we developed **Advanced Mode**.

The Simulator assumes a number of default values to simplify the UX, including for reward APRs, fees, holding periods, and valuation / payout ranges.

In Advanced Mode, you can tinker with each of these parameters to your heart's content, and **see visually** how various parameters adjustments impacting the market.
