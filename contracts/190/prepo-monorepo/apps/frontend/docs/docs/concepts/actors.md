# 3 Key Actors 🧑‍💼 👩‍🚀 🧙

There are 3 key actors in the prePO system, each with their own unique responsibilities and incentives.

## Liquidity Providers

Liquidity Providers (LPs) provide liquidity in the form of USD stablecoins to prePO Markets.

LPs are incentivsed with [3 Layers of Rewards](/concepts/rewards), and enjoy [minimized risk](/concepts/risk-minimisation).

Put simply: any LPs who are yield farming with stablecoins would be better off providing liquidity to a prePO market in order to capture additional rewards.

## Traders

Traders open long or short positions in prePO Markets, the net sum of their activity determining estimated valuations of pre-public entities.

If a Trader exits their position at a better price than they entered in at, they’ve made a profit. The profit comes from other actors in the system.

However, it's not a zero-sum game, due to the [3 Layers of Rewards](/concepts/rewards). A Trader could be making a loss on a WeWork long position, but still make an overall profit due to PPO incentives and collateral farming!

## Pregens

Finally, we have our beloved pregens (PPO token stakers), who participate in the prePO [DAO governance system](/governance).

Pregens are able to make and vote on proposals, including proposals for the creation and settlement of prePO markets.

[PPO token incentives](/tokenomics) ensure that Pregens are rewarded for their efforts, and that their incentives are aligned with the best interests of the protocol.
