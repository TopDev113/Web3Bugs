The prePO protocol is governed by Pregens (PPO token stakers), using four distinct tools: [PPO](/tokenomics) (the prePO token), [Snapshot polls](/governance/glossary#snapshot), the [Discourse forum](/governance/glossary#discource-governance-forum), and [Discord governance channels](/governance/glossary#discord-governance-channels).

Together, these tools allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes to the prePO protocol in a decentralized manner with no central authority.
