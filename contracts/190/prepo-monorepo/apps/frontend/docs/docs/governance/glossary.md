### Discord Governance Channels

All governance discussion - whether general, or related to PREPs or Temperature Checks - occurs in governance channels within the [prePO Discord community](https://url.prepo.io/discord-docs).

### Discourse Governance Forum

[forum.prepo.io](https://forum.prepo.io) is a public forum created exclusively for Pregens to post their Proposals and Temperature Checks for community review. The forum is hosted on Discourse, a popular open source forum software.

### Precog

A Precog is a representative member of the Pregen community that has been elected by other Pregens to sit on the Precog Council.

### PREP

PREP stands for prePO Proposal. Each official proposal to the prePO protocol will have its own numbered PREP, e.g. PREP-1, PREP-2, etc.

### Precog Council

The Precog Council is responsible for taking PREPs through the Proposal Process, and for the day-to-day operations of prePO. The Precog Council is elected via Precog Elections.

### Precog Election

Precogs are elected by Pregens by way of Snapshot vote. Pregens are ultimately always in control of who sits on the Council, and may propose a snap election at any time.

### Pregen

A Pregen is any individual who owns PPO tokens which have been staked.

Pregens are responsible for proposing, discussing, and voting on PREPs.

### Snapshot

[vote.prepo.io](https://vote.prepo.io) is an off-chain, gas-free voting interface that allows Pregens to vote for or against Proposals, or signal sentiment about [Temperature Checks](/governance/glossary#temperature-check).

### Temperature Check

A Temperature Check is a non-binding Snapshot poll, which may be used to gauge sentiment of the Pregen community around a particular issue.
