# Tests

Run `yarn install` in the root `prepo-monorepo` directory to install all packages needed for testing

**Commands** and **Configuration** only apply to tests defined in the same project. The only two project directories contestants should concern themselves with are `apps/smart-contracts/core` and `packages/prepo-shared-contracts`.

### Commands

- Run tests for all contracts within a project: `yarn t`
- Run tests w/ code coverage: `yarn t:coverage`
- Run a specific test suite: `yarn hardhat test test/<test name>.test.ts`

### Configuration

- Edit `hardhat.config.ts` to setup connections to different networks
- To enable gas reporting, add `REPORT_GAS=true` to `.env`
