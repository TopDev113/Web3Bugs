👋 Hello and welcome to the contest channel for the $30K USDC **Yield** contest!

📆 Contest opens January 28, 2022, at 0:00 UTC and runs through January 30, 2022 at 23:59 UTC (3 days).

Please give a warm welcome back to the Yield team, specifically @Alberto | Yield and @themystery who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via DM. 

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this contest, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

Hi all, I'm delighted to be here again as a sponsor.

I've judged now about a half a dozen contests and I know of the tricks that you guys use to score easy issues. Expect none of those.

We've cleaned up the code with great attention, and we've written a comprehensive Readme complete with design decisions and intentional deviations from best practices.

[26-Jan-22 10:09 PM] Alberto | Yield#8665
So, hopefully, only real issues remain. We are not auditors ourselves, so those more specialized techniques that you know how to use and we don't might pay off. Things like adversarial thinking and all that that Joran Honig was tweeting about the last few days.


[26-Jan-22 10:13 PM] Alberto | Yield#8665
Please ask any questions that arise. @themystery has written this code and knows it more intimately, but when it comes to the workings of the Yield Protocol in general I will weigh in if needed.


[26-Jan-22 10:13 PM] Alberto | Yield#8665
Good hunting!


[26-Jan-22 10:46 PM] themystery#1414
Good luck everyone! Looking forward to your submissions. Please feel free to send me questions if any


[27-Jan-22 05:05 AM] Dravee#7832
Hey, thank you for this! Sometimes it takes so much time reporting all those small tricks that it feels exhausting. For a 3 days contest, it's encouraging to know that it should be a quality time even for wardens 🐺 !


[27-Jan-22 05:09 AM] Alberto | Yield#8665
You will find 235 sloc of completely new code, and about 500 sloc of code reworked from audited sources. I think it should be quality time for 3 days 😄


[27-Jan-22 05:15 AM] Alberto | Yield#8665
Please read the readme carefully, there are a few ways in which users can get rekt that we are fine with

And we missed to put the approve race condition on the readme, but come on. That's not a real vulnerability.

Also, if you are wondering about the LadleStorage.sol import (which is out of scope), it's here: https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2/blob/master/contracts/LadleStorage.sol

Guys, seriously, I love you and I love the work that you do, but if you run a script to find vulnerabilities and you don't check that the output makes sense you are wasting the time of the sponsor and the judge.

Let's work together to find those vulnerabilities, ok?
I'm happy to spend as much time as necessary explaining the code, how was it tested, where it could be failing. I'm here to help.


[28-Jan-22 08:04 AM] Alberto | Yield#8665
And so is @themystery


[28-Jan-22 08:05 AM] Dravee#7832
You are assuming 2 == 2 a little fast here 😂 (joke)

If a sentence in a comment doesn't end with a dot `.`, should I report ?

Yours ends with a question mark, reported. [that's how scripts judge code xdd]
