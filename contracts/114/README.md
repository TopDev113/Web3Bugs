# Contest Scope

This is a contest to evaluate the Aave V3 Yield Source contract for PoolTogether.

This contract adheres to the [Yield Source Interface](https://github.com/pooltogether/yield-source-interface/blob/main/contracts/IYieldSource.sol), which is a generic interface that allows a Yield Source Prize Pool to use an external contract to generate interest. As long as a contract supports the Yield Source Interface, it can be plugged into the Yield Source Prize Pool. This makes it easy to add new yield sources.

This contract also adheres to the ERC20 standard and mints tokens to the Prize Pool when users deposit into it. These tokens represent the share of deposits owned by a Prize Pool. Users can then withdraw their deposits from the Prize Pool and these shares are then burnt. This flow is illustrated in the following diagrams:

# Areas of Concern

The main areas of concern are the following:
- is the unlimited approval of the Aave V3 Pool contract safe? Focus on the [following line](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L183) and the functions `decreaseERC20Allowance` and `increaseERC20Allowance`.
- are the shares being calculated correctly? Focus on the `_tokenToShares` and `_sharesToToken` functions. Keep in mind that aTokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio.
- is the minting and burning of shares being done correctly? Focus on the `supplyTokenTo` and `redeemToken` functions.
- is there any reentrancy attack possible? Focus on the functions to withdraw and deposit.
- are functions being restricted correctly in term of ownership and managership?

# Gas Optimization

When suggesting gas optimizations, please run the `yarn test` command and write down the improvement in gas usage in your report. Don't forget to set the `REPORT_GAS` environment variable to `true` in order to generate the gas report.
