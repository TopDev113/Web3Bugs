PoolTogether Yield Source that uses [Aave](https://aave.com) V3 to generate yield by lending any ERC20 token deposited into the Yield Source to Aave.

## Development

Clone this repository and enter the directory:
```
cd aave-v3-yield-source
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```


### Env

We use [direnv](https://direnv.net) to manage environment variables. You'll likely need to install it.

Copy `.envrc.example` and write down the env variables needed to run this project.
```
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Once your env variables are setup, load them with:
```
direnv allow
```

### Compile

Run the following command to compile the contract:
```
yarn compile
```

### Test

We use the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) ecosystem to test our contracts.

To run unit tests:

```
yarn test
```

To run coverage:

```
yarn coverage
```

### Polygon fork

Before deploying, you can make sure your implementation works by deploying a Yield Source Prize Pool on a fork of Polygon.

To do so, run the following command:
```
yarn run-yield-source-fork
```


### Code quality

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format TypeScript and Solidity code. Use it by running:

```
yarn format
