hey @Michael De Luca! i'm pleased to intro you to my teammates @‚õÖCloudEllie and @itsmetechjay | C4 - they'll be guiding you through the contest setup process, expect to hear soon on next steps.


[21-Dec-21 10:13 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Awesome! Thanks! And great to meet you all.


[21-Dec-21 10:14 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Well @Michael De Luca , we meet again! üéâ


[21-Dec-21 10:15 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Had such a great experience last time!

Well it's great to have you back!

I think you know the drill, but let's revisit, for the sake of this channel being useful üôÇ 

I'm Ellie, and @itsmetechjay | C4 and I will be your liaisons of sorts with the C4 warden community. We'll do our best to walk you through all the things that can help make your contest as successful as possible, and you can feel free to ping us with any questions along the way.

Couple of things to kick things off: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ We're setting up private repos for your contest. Can you send us a list of github accounts we should invite? 

There are two repos:
**- Contest repo: **will house the contest docs, code for review, and any additional notes for wardens
**- Findings repo: **where issues are submitted (so, most of your to-dos there are for after the contest closes)

Usually it's the same group of people on both repos, but wanted to flag this in case you want different people on the two repos. 

2Ô∏è‚É£  Here's a doc that summarizes all the key info you'll need ‚Äî basically a one-pager/checklist for your contest: https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4

Normally I offer to jump on an intro call as well, but given we're out of office from Dec 23 - Jan 2, I think we're cutting it pretty close! But LMK if there's anything at all I can help with in the next <checks watch> 25 hours or so. üôÇ

[21-Dec-21 10:18 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Thanks. I'll go over all of this and have the info for your shortly.

thankyou hi5 

[21-Dec-21 11:26 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Awesome. Also, just as a heads-up, the C4 team will be out of the office for winter break from December 23rd through January 2nd. If you need anything urgently during that time, you can ping @ninek | C4 , but he may also be slow to respond. ‚òÉÔ∏è 

Meanwhile, if you have questions for us, now is a good time for that! üòÅ


[21-Dec-21 11:28 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Basically, your contest launches at the end of our first day back from vacation (0:00 UTC on Jan 4 = 6pm CST on Jan 3), so it would be enormously helpful if you could have your code & readme all set up in your repo on that Monday morning (Jan 3). Does that sound feasible?


[21-Dec-21 11:38 AM] ninek | C4#1475
and i will be checking in over break while the team is out to help with timely needs

Hi again @Michael De Luca! üëã  Here are the repos for the contest:

**Contest repo: **https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi
**Findings repo:** https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings

I invited your GitHub handle but let us know if there are others. üôÇ

Pinned a message.


[03-Jan-22 07:10 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Happy New Year @Michael De Luca, checking in to see if you have all that you need to get the contest repo set up.  The contest goes live in about 9 hours.

And please let us know if there are other folks we should tag for warden questions.


[03-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Hi @itsmetechjay | C4 yes, I have everything I need. holidays kinda slowed me down, naturally.


[03-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
I will be configuring and committing stuff asap to get ready for the contest opening.


[03-Jan-22 08:29 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Awesome and sounds great.  I'll set up the contest channel for warden questions and tag you shortly.


[03-Jan-22 08:56 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Hi @Michael De Luca I know you're busy getting the repo set up, but I just realized we haven't received the award funds from you, so when you have a moment, could you transfer those over? I believe we've received the $5k org fee, but have not yet received the $25k in prize funds. Thanks!


[03-Jan-22 09:26 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
I'll alert the team right now. Thanks!

hi5 

[03-Jan-22 01:21 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Hey @Michael De Luca, checking in on the repo ETA. We are about 2.5 hours from the contest launch and will need some time to review and do any needed cleanup before we go live.


[03-Jan-22 01:23 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Yup, I am about 15 minutes way from completing the `2022-01-xdefi` readme


[03-Jan-22 01:23 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
and the `XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution` at https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0 is locked in


[03-Jan-22 01:26 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Awesome thank you!


[03-Jan-22 01:29 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Do I decide the split between main award pot and gas optimization pot (say $22k and $3k), or is it all $25k for general rewards?


[03-Jan-22 01:31 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Or should I just say `$25,000 USDC main award pot`?


[03-Jan-22 01:32 PM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
We typically allocate 5% to gas opt unless you tell us otherwise


[03-Jan-22 01:32 PM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
But you can leave that section for us to review & firm up


[03-Jan-22 01:45 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
ok, the Readme is ready


[03-Jan-22 01:52 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Hey @Michael De Luca so for the award pool, are we taking 5% of the $25K for gas optimization?  I'll update the name back to XDEFI as well.


[03-Jan-22 01:52 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Sure, I don't mind. To be honest, I care about gas optimizations in the `XDEFIDistribution` contract only, and would be happy with 10% dedication


[03-Jan-22 01:52 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
What do you think?


[03-Jan-22 01:59 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
tagging in @ninek | C4 to help answer the gas optimization question.


[03-Jan-22 02:25 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Thanks for spotting that error in the Readme. If you don't mind, I force-pushed the correction (and another correction, 2.55x instead of 100x) so that the history is "clean"


[03-Jan-22 02:26 PM] ninek | C4#1475
we can't separate gas awards per contract, so if we did 10% it'd apply to all valid gas optimizations. is that ok with you?


[03-Jan-22 02:26 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Sure, sounds good


[03-Jan-22 02:30 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
So we are good to update the awards in the repo to:

$22,500 main 
$2,500 gas?


[03-Jan-22 02:30 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Yup!


[03-Jan-22 02:33 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Ok great - the repo is good to go. I'll make it public in a little bit. And then our helpful C4 bot will pop in here once the contest goes live.


[03-Jan-22 02:33 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Just out of curiosity, if only one person finds a single minuscule gas optimization, they get $2,500? And it will apply to both contacts?


[03-Jan-22 02:34 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Sorry for the last minute audible, but I guess I would rather split the $25k to all based on severity of the bug, info, or size of the gas optimization. I guess I was confused about how exactly we would reward gas vs info vs bugs


[03-Jan-22 02:35 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
If we/you/I think we can be fair in how we reward (and I think we can) then perhaps no separate specific gas reward? Does that make sense? Looking for your experience/guidance here.


[03-Jan-22 02:52 PM] ninek | C4#1475
the lowest number of gas optimizations we've awarded out of 50+ contests is 4. it is possible only 1 awardable gas opt is found although in my view the likelihood is low. it seems likely to me that a handful of useful optimizations will come in. if there are zero, we can shift all the funds to other findings.

with the way our awarding algorithm works, we have to set aside a specific amount for gas optimizations, otherwise gas optimizations would not be awarded at all, so we require a minimum 5% allocation.


[03-Jan-22 02:54 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Fair enough. The way the current 10% is structured seems reasonable to me.

**Your contest is LIVE! üéâ**

Hi @üíºsponsors ‚Äî your contest is now LIVE! 

‚ùó**Note: **This also means the code freeze on your contest repo is now in effect.

Just a quick note - Don't be surprised if things are quiet at first; that's very typical, as the wardens get to work. The visible activity tends to happen towards the end of the contest, so "quiet" ‚â† "nothing is happening"

{Reactions}
yay 

[04-Jan-22 06:28 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
How do I reply to a user to ask them to verify or confirm something? I don't want to mark something invalid if perhaps they lacked a clearer explanation


[04-Jan-22 06:32 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
I assume with the `question` label.


[05-Jan-22 08:06 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
You can reach out to them directly via Discord DM.


[05-Jan-22 08:51 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Hey @Michael De Luca, just a reminder for what comes next.  Once the contest closes, we'll ask you to review the findings repo just to give it a first pass, before we pass it off to the judge. This initial review period (ideally 2-3 days after the contest closes) is intended to de-duplicate the findings as well as to give you an opportunity to comment on risk severity if you disagree with the wardens' assessment.  It looks like you have already started the labeling process. üôÇ 

Once you're finished with de-duping and labelling, let us know and we'll pass things off to the judge. And of course, let us know if you have questions along the way. Thanks!


[05-Jan-22 10:25 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Are those user handles in the findings their Discord handle?


[05-Jan-22 10:26 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Yep. I'm just doing first passes to filter out or acknowledge issues, since, from experience, it's easier to mark duplicate labels once all the issues are in

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05-Jan-22 10:26 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
And often, there's one issue in each set of duplicates that ends up being the most verbose or well described that I link to as the "original"


[05-Jan-22 10:27 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Even if it's not really the original


[05-Jan-22 10:27 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
for the most part. If there are ones you can't track down, we can help you with those.


[05-Jan-22 10:27 AM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Yup all of that sounds great!


[05-Jan-22 11:59 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
I can't find user `csanuragjain` for issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/23


[05-Jan-22 12:02 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
here is their full discord handle. does that help? csanuragjain#5772


[05-Jan-22 12:04 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Yes, thanks!


[05-Jan-22 12:04 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Sweet!


[06-Jan-22 12:52 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
So I recall from the Maple audit that we needed to create PRs to demonstrate how each non-duplicate issue was resolved, but there is a bit of a problem in this case. A handful of these very valid raised issues have resulted in some larger changes, which I think will make it more difficult to make one-to-one PRs for each, given how much some of the code will change (in terms of lines). Is this a strict requirement?


[06-Jan-22 04:02 PM] C4#0000
**üèÅ Your contest is now closed**

Hi @üíºsponsors, your contest just ended but we may still see a few issues trickle in. 

Next up is the **Sponsor Review** process that Jay mentioned previously. Our ideal timeline on that would be to have it wrapped up in 2-3 days, so we can shift into judging and awarding in a timely fashion. But please let us know if you have any questions or need more time.

chefskiss hi5 

[07-Jan-22 06:28 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Nope, not at all strict. üôÇ


[07-Jan-22 06:29 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
More of a nice to have for our report -- like it's nice to have a comment on a per-issue basis because then it's crystal clear that Mitigation A resolved Finding X, if you know what I mean. But that's the primary way those comments/PR links are used on our end.


[09-Jan-22 03:11 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Ok, I responded to and tagged all issues, and marked all duplicates

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[09-Jan-22 03:12 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
I also finished all the code changes, but will try to segregate them into easier to manage commits so they can be more easily linked to the individual issues they address

{Reactions}
hi5 

[10-Jan-22 07:35 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Amazing, thanks so much! I'll review ASAP.


[10-Jan-22 07:59 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Great. I already made all the changes needed, but will wait for you to confirm the deduped issues before I cherrypick them into individual commits. Does that make sense?


[10-Jan-22 08:20 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Yep, I think so üôÇ

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Jan-22 12:02 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Just want to confirm that I'm waiting for C4 wardens to validate issues and my tags before I proceed to link each issue, or set of issues, to resolving commits.


[13-Jan-22 06:30 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
IMO you should feel free to proceed with linking your commits based on the tags you created. The judge will be working on it for the next few days and we don't open the repo up to wardens until the judging is complete, awards announced, and report published.


[13-Jan-22 06:31 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
BTW I've been meaning to drop you a note of appreciation for your clear and thoughtful comments on the wardens' submissions. I can already tell this will be a really educational report. You've done an outstanding job.


[13-Jan-22 08:57 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
Thanks! It was fun and educational for myself as well.


[13-Jan-22 08:59 PM] Michael De Luca#2763
I resolved all the issues. It was harder than I thought to link issues to commits, since needed refactoring resulted in impossible to isolate commits. Hopefully the detailed resolve comments I left to each issue, with specific links to lines and blocks in the release candidate contracts, is sufficient. Let me know!


[14-Jan-22 07:19 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
That sounds just great. Really appreciate the thought and care you're putting into all this -- makes our work much easier!


[20-Jan-22 08:40 AM] Michael De Luca#2763
Hey all. Any updates or questions? No rush, just checking.


[20-Jan-22 09:09 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
Yep, the judge handed everything back yesterday and we're just running the validations & award calculations. Will hopefully have awards announced by EOD tomorrow üôÇ


[20-Jan-22 09:09 AM] ‚õÖCloudEllie#4509
And then we can get to drafting up your report.
