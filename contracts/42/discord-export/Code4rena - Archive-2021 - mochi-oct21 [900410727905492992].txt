👋 Hello!

@terMAX @leekt216 I'm in the middle of getting the project set up and am running the tests in `mochi-core`. Looks like the MockCssrRouter is looking for the `SushiswapV2TokenAdapter.sol` file from the @mochify/cssr package, but it doesn't exist. Closest thing is either `SushiswapV2LPAdapter.sol` , or `UniswapV2TokenAdapter.sol`. Do you know what it's supposed to be? Here's the error message:

We will double check and get back to you asap.

It looks like that file has a bunch of imports it doesn't need. I have the tests running now. If they all pass (so far so good) I'll submit a PR with the (few) changes I needed to make to make things pass.


[21-Oct-21 12:34 PM] Tim Coulter (tjc.eth)#8850
As an update, these two tests failed. Looks like they only differ by 1 line (first `vault.borrow(...)` in the second test). Would recommend renaming them, in general, to help explain the differentiation. The second one looks like it's perhaps expecting a different revert (or at least getting one it didn't expect).  I'll post the results too.

I don't know what counts as a submission, since this is my first time using code4rena. Since this is within your tests, and is getting the project set up, let's consider it a freebie! 🙂


[21-Oct-21 01:35 PM] Tim Coulter (tjc.eth)#8850
@terMAX It looks like the two tests above aren't correct (or at least, they don't match with the MochiVault contract within the repo). My observations I've found so far: 

- The only check that results in the `">cf"` error message is within the `withdraw()` function, and from what I can tell, `withdraw()` is not called from within the `borrow()` function, which is the function under test. (And conceptually, calling `withdraw()` within `borrow()` doesn't make much sense).
- Based on what I can see in the `withdraw()` function, if a collateral factor check were intended for the `borrow()` function, I would assume the check would need to occur after calculating the new debt (`details[_id].debt + _amount`). There is a check for minimum debt, but nothing for collateral factor.
- Line 228 of MochiVault.sol appears to squash the ability to borrow more than your collateral factor (https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L228). Compare that line with the `>cf` check within the `withdraw()` function (https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-mochi/blob/main/projects/mochi-core/contracts/vault/MochiVault.sol#L204), and you'll see that the new debt (`_amount`) can never be greater than the collateral factor, since line 228 readjusts `_amount` such that it's always less than or equal to `maxMinted`. 

Given the above, perhaps this is why the tests fail? Looks like the `borrow()` function is not supposed to revert with `>cf`, so there may be an issue with the tests.

@ninek | C4 (or whoever). I need help - is this the kind of stuff that counts as a submission?


[21-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Hi Tim - IMO you might want to move this to a DM convo with @terMAX and figure out between the two of you if they warrant a formal submission


[21-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
I'm afraid I'm not in a position to make that judgment call myself


[21-Oct-21 01:52 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
you are free to submit it, but the C4 team lets the contest judge make 100% of the calls.


[21-Oct-21 01:59 PM] Tim Coulter (tjc.eth)#8850
Ah, makes sense @⛅CloudEllie @sockdrawermoney, thanks!

👍 

[21-Oct-21 02:01 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
as @⛅CloudEllie said, it's generally a good idea to keep discussions like this to DMs in the spirit of competition though 🙂

(feel free to delete if you like)


[21-Oct-21 02:03 PM] Tim Coulter (tjc.eth)#8850
Nah, all good. A fresh set of green tests is pretty important as a jumping off point for exploration (it's where I start). Definitely want everyone to be on the same playing field (and make sure it's worth their time!)


[21-Oct-21 02:05 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
all good, I hadn't followed the whole conversation to catch what sort of issue was being discussed.


[21-Oct-21 07:42 PM] leekt216#7585
seems irrelavant file has been submitted to github will clean it up


[21-Oct-21 08:57 PM] terMAX#0690
Thanks @leekt216


[23-Oct-21 08:15 AM] Laezo#5406
@terMAX @leekt216 can you accept?


[23-Oct-21 09:11 AM] terMAX#0690
+


[25-Oct-21 01:00 AM] elprofesor#7324
Hi sorry just clarifying, is the mochi-library part of the scope for the latest mochi contest? Just making sure I didn't misunderstand anything.


[25-Oct-21 03:26 AM] leekt216#7585
no it is not in the scope, just need that for compiling the core/cssr


[25-Oct-21 05:49 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Pinned a message.

Hi all - please welcome @svcrypto from the Mochi team, who is also available to answer questions (either here or via DM)!

Hi! Is there a list of live deployed contracts available?


[26-Oct-21 02:17 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
I’m curious why you’re asking. (You might have missed the detail but the contest prohibits testing against live contracts)


[26-Oct-21 02:32 PM] dmitriia#8141
Checking live contract parameters is usually useful.
Any public testing should be prohibited, of course


[26-Oct-21 02:41 PM] sockdrawermoney#0001
Cool cool. Just wanted to make sure you knew 🙂

@🐺wardens The Mochi contest is now **closed**! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

**What's next:** the Mochi team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. We'll announce awards 🤑🏆 in #🐺wardens, and keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜.
