# Current todo list:

1) Test fee mechanism works (order book tipping specific fees etc)
2) Oracle price change mechanism works


# Interesting things to remember to test.

1) Massive swing cases where the value increases or decreases by more than 100% in a single go.
2) All value withdrawn from one side
3) Investigate front running consequences.
