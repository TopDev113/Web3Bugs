can anyone come up with a reentrancy attack on the ERC1155.safeTransferFrom? https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional/blob/main/contracts/external/actions/ERC1155Action.sol#L128-L132. we don't do any check there and it might be safer to but i'm struggling to think of a way to profit from reentrancy there

Maybe wait with these discussion until after the submission deadline. If anyone comes up with an attack now, everyone will submit it and it wouldn't be fair for the original submitter


[31-Aug-21 11:29 AM] cmichel#0001
Or would it be fair because they didn't provide a clear attack path / impact description? üòÅ


[31-Aug-21 12:50 PM] Jeff Wu | Notional#4477
Sure fair enough
