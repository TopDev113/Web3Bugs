# Protocol overview üîÆ

**We're buliding permissionless vaults ecosystem for trustless automatic DeFi strategies.
The protocol is designed for implementing multi-token cross-protocol liquidity rebalancing.**

The Vault contracts hold the tokens and rebalance them both inside other protocols and between them. Strategy contracts interact with Vault contracts definig the rebalancing parameters.

**Liquidity provider**

Users pick a strategy that fits their needs and allocate their assets into a vault to earn yield. When the assets are deposited, users get composable LP tokens (ERC-20).

**Strategies**

Strategies are smart-contracts that implement the models to provide effective liquidity allocation. Different market events can trigger the strategies to initiate rebalance.

**Vaults**

Vaults allocate multiple ERC-20 tokens into other DeFi protocols and rebalance the liquidity in accordance with Strategies inside and between the protocols.

A typical vault and strategy setup would be made by using Mellow Permissioless Vaults _deployVault_ function. As a result, the following set of smart contracts (called Vault System) would be established **for every strategy and token pair**:

## Protocol architecture üõ†

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*L4INk2ZLKCylmw1Yt28JTw.png)
There are two types of contracts on the diagram:

1.  **Protocol contracts** (pink color) ‚Äî these are the protocol contracts that are deployed in one instance;
2.  **Vault contracts** (purple color) ‚Äî these are the contracts deployed by users (vault owners/strategists) by using **protocol contracts.** Essentially everyone can create a set of Vault contracts.

We can logically separate contracts into Vault Groups. Each Vault Group is a set of contracts that allows managing and creating a vault of a specific Vault Kind. Vault Governance is a contract that can:

1.  Deploy a new vault via a VaultGovernance#deployVault method
2.  Manage governance params for specific vaults

Upon Vault creation, the Vault Registry contract mints a new ERC-721 token that represents that Vault.

### External calls made by our contracts:

- Aave
  - LendingPool: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getReserveData`
  - aTokens: `balanceOf`
- Uniswap
  - Router: `exactInput`, `exactOutput`
  - NonfungiblePositionManager: `increaseLiquidity`, `decreaseLiquidity`, `collect`, `positions`
- Yearn
  - Yearn Vault Registry: `latestVault`
  - yTokens: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `balanceOf`

## How we protect the protocol üîê

VaultRegistry mints a unique ERC721 NFT for each Vault. Access control is based on that NFTs:

1. Nft Owner can freely push and pull liquidity from the vault
2. Nft approved person can push, but pull only to other vaults which are in the same [Vault System](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-permissionless-vaults/definitions#vault-system)
3. ERC-721 ApprovedForAll cannot do anything (i.e. irrelevant to access control)

Additionally Protocol Governance admin can perform certain tasks on protocol management and emergency shutdown:

1. Disable / migrate strategies (by changing approve rights for Nfts in VaultRegistry)
2. Set strategy and protocol params on VaultGovernance level, incl setting deposit limits to 0
3. Reclaiming tokens that are sent by mistake on vaults

Only tokens whitelisted by Protocol Governance can be used for creating new Vaults.

## Setup, tests, etc. ü™Ñ

See Contracts [README.md](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/main/mellow-vaults/README.md)

### Run unit tests

Required env variables (could be addred to `.env` file):

```
MAINNET_RPC=<ethereum rpc endpoint>
KOVAN_RPC=<ethereum rpc endpoint>
```

MAINNET_RPC should be able to serve acrhive node api. E.g. [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) can do that.

```bash
yarn
yarn coverage
```

**Tests coverage report**

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

### Deploy

Required env variables (could be added to `.env` file):

```
MAINNET_RPC=<ethereum rpc endpoint>
KOVAN_RPC=<ethereum rpc endpoint>
MAINNET_DEPLOYER_PK=0x.... # for mainnet deploy
KOVAN_DEPLOYER_PK=0x.... # for kovan deploy
```

```bash
yarn
yarn deploy:hardhat
# or yarn deploy:kovan
# or yarn deploy:mainnet
```

### Check contract size

```bash
yarn
yarn size
```


### Good luck and may the Force be with you!‚ú®
