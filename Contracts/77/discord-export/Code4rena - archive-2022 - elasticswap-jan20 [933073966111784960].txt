Hello! I sent a friend request too, the Clyde bot intercepted my message 😅 . I have a small question too.


[23-Jan-22 07:36 PM] UncleGrandpa925#5820
Should the formula for gamma in the case of betaDecay `γ = ΔX / X / 2 * ( ΔY / β^ )` instead of  `γ = ΔX / X / 2 * ( ΔX / β^ )`?

Found a typo in document https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap/blob/develop/ElasticSwapMath.md?plain=1#L211. betaDecay should be deltaBeta

[24-Jan-22 04:55 AM] 0xean#1367
Yup, good catch.


[24-Jan-22 04:58 AM] 0xean#1367
No, I believe the document is correct here.  Let me confirm with our math guy tho.


[24-Jan-22 04:59 AM] UncleGrandpa925#5820
👍 thanks


[24-Jan-22 05:00 AM] 0xean#1367
Thank all of you for digging into this!

He confirmed, formula is correct as written (and that is what I implemented in the Solidity as well)


[24-Jan-22 05:05 AM] UncleGrandpa925#5820
I see. Thanks! I thought the formula for X should be a mirror of Y, but it’s a lot more interesting than that 😄


[24-Jan-22 05:05 AM] 0xean#1367
haha, right.  Yea, the math is a bit hard to understand at first.  It took us about 6 weeks with 3 of us in front on a white board.


[24-Jan-22 05:06 AM] UncleGrandpa925#5820
Yeah, really like the idea of this project, I used to think this is not possible until I saw the project


[24-Jan-22 05:07 AM] 0xean#1367
I can tell you, we also thought it not possible and questioned our sanity a few times in that 6 weeks

updated and fixed.


[24-Jan-22 08:11 AM] wuwe1#3707
Cool, interesting idea btw.


[24-Jan-22 10:15 AM] 0xean#1367
Thank you!


[25-Jan-22 07:21 AM] 0xean#1367
Any time!

I'm trying to run 'yarn test' and it says there's an error in the package.json file. @0xean


[25-Jan-22 01:31 PM] 0xean#1367
What is the error?


[25-Jan-22 01:33 PM] 0xean#1367
Just tried it on a fresh install and it worked. What version of node are you running?


[25-Jan-22 01:33 PM] 0xean#1367
@wagyu


[25-Jan-22 01:39 PM] wagyu#8255
16.13.1(node)


[25-Jan-22 01:50 PM] 0xean#1367
what is the error message you see?


[25-Jan-22 01:51 PM] 0xean#1367
I am using v16.9.1


[25-Jan-22 01:51 PM] 0xean#1367
@wagyu


[25-Jan-22 02:09 PM] wagyu#8255
Command "test" not found


[25-Jan-22 02:29 PM] 0xean#1367
Can you print your working directory? I think you need to move into the elasticswap folder


[25-Jan-22 02:29 PM] 0xean#1367
And then do yarn and then yarn test


[25-Jan-22 02:37 PM] 0xean#1367
```
cd  ./elasticswap
yarn
yarn test
```


[25-Jan-22 03:04 PM] wagyu#8255
It's saying error :cannot find module 'nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle'


[25-Jan-22 03:05 PM] 0xean#1367
when you run `yarn` in the `elasticswap` folder?


[25-Jan-22 03:05 PM] 0xean#1367
(not yarn test)


[25-Jan-22 04:09 PM] wagyu#8255
I got it to work


[25-Jan-22 04:36 PM] 0xean#1367
👍
