# Authoring of contracts in this directory

The contracts included in this directory are flattened versions of OpenZeppelin contracts. This pattern of manually importing is necessary for conforming solidity versions across files and also helps to freeze features at the time of writing.

Justin Goro is not the author of these contracts but they have been edited a bit to fit in with Limbo.
