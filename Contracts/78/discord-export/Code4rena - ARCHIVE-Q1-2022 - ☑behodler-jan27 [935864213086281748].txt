@here Hi wardens, the README has been updated with a link to a video explaining things, first from a high level overview and then drilling into code. Understanding the motivations and having a grasp of the cryptoeconomics will make reading the code quite a bit easier but if you prefer the written word to video, the documentation both on the repo and on our site should be more than enough.

For now the video is an mp4 that opens in your browser. Tomorrow it will be a youtube playlist.

PSA
Hi wardens. One issue I see coming up a lot is something that appears as a vulnerability in a vacuum but in the correct context isn't. Limbo is basically open to admin manipulation until the conigured bool is set to true. The purpose of this is so that when I deploy Limbo initially, I can configure it quickly. If this wasn't in place, I'd have to issue proposals and vote on them just to set up the contract. Once configured is set to true, the admin powers are permanently removed.
The pre configured state will be during a time where I'm the only person who knows the contract exists. And since there are no value flows, there will be no detection by mining bots.


[30-Jan-22 07:12 PM] Justin Goro#1527
On a similar note, with governance, the proposals which cause havoc to their target contract are not considered threats since the community can simply vote them down. And we might have some perculiar reason to want such proposals. Perhaps it's the only way to thwart a more dangerous exploit.

Gas optimizations are prized for Limbo, Flan and FlanBackstop since they are user facing and involve value calculations of APYs vs gas cost. Minor gas optimizations for LimboDAO and so on are not highly sought after. Only significant gas optimizations on the latter would be welcome.

“If it’s all one big video carry on” 😂 I appreciate the time you’ve put into this explanation!

Thanks, @GeekyLumberjack. I was a bit surprised it added up to almost 3 hours. I was aiming for 45 min but got a bit carried away.

PSA to prevent logging an issue I won't accept:
Some of you may have noticed that it's impossible to list Scarcity on Limbo as a stakeable token because the migration mechanics would break due to balanceOf calculations being thrown off. The solution is to use the ProxyRegister contract to wrap Scarcity in a generic ERC20 token and to list that as a perpetual soul for staking. No code change is required.

Lol @ the comments:
> Limbo.sol:487: [...] Anticipates moving tokens to Limbo2 (wen Limbo2??)
> UniswapHelper.sol:17:  [...] managing a just-in-time (Justin Time?) oracle

"FlanBackstop.sol:45: //USDC and USDT have 6 decimal places because large stablecoin transfers are exactly where you'd like to find accidental bugs" is a favourite of mine

Thanks, everyone! Very high quality submissions. I haven't reviewed them all but I have reviewed most and I have to say I'm really impressed at the effort, quality and scrutiny put in. 10/10 would recommend this process to other crypto projects.
