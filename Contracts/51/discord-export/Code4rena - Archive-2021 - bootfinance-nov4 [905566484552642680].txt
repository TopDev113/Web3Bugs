@chickenpie347 I'm going over your litepaper. Can you clarify the axes in these figures?

fig 1. 
y axis = fraction of pool that is token A vs Token B, 0.5 = 50%
x axis = price of token A in $

slippage 1% trade
y axis = slippage in decimals 0.02 = 2% for a trade of token that makes up 1% of the LP pool
x axis = price of token A in $

I just updated this in the docs:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/core-contracts/diagrams/TokenDistribution.drawio.png to help comprehend the gauge, staking, vest lock, and staking reward claim.   This replaces the former diagram that was there.
