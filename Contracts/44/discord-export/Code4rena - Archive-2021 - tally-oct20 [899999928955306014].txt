Welcome folks! I'm going to drop a diagram of how this all works together once I get my kids down

A couple things that were funny for me writing this contract — it's odd to be given a contract address by the 0x API and be told to "trust it" once receiving a quote. I did my best to think through what might happen if we were given a malicious contract address, eg because the 0x API was MitM'd

Another callout. This is part of a bigger system that includes `GovernorBravo` as the DAO behind all of this. I'll try to get a test up to show how it should work with a mock... the tests we have outside this repo weren't straightforward to detangle, or it would already be included

I'll be online on and off today until around midnight ET. I'm generally around on Discord all day, but during the work day I have to batch messages so I can take calls, etc. If I take more than a couple hours to get back to a DM, feel free to ping me here or in the Tally Discord to get my attention.

That's at https://chat.tally.cash
