## Contract overview

### Dependencies

The main contract is `Swap.sol`, which executes quotes provided off-chain by the
[0x API](https://0x.org/docs/api) in the Tally wallet, taking swap fees for the
DAO. It relies on `SafeMath.sol`, `SafeERC20.sol`, and `ReentrancyGuard.sol`
from the OpenZeppelin contracts library.

## System overview

The Tally wallet is an EOA wallet that runs as a browser extension. Though Tally
isn't a "smart contract wallet", preferring to custody user funds outside smart
contracts to save on gas, a number of features in the wallet require paired
smart contracts. Tally Swap is one of those features.
