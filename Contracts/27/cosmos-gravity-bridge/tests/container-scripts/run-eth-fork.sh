# Starts a hardhat RPC backend that is based off of a fork of Ethereum mainnet. This is useful in that we take
# over the account of a major Uniswap liquidity provider and from there we can test many things that are infeasible
# to do with a Geth backend, simply becuase reproducting that state on our testnet would be far too complex to consider
# The tradeoff here is that hardhat is an ETH dev environment and not an actual ETH implementation, as such the outputs
# may be different
