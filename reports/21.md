# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Sherlock smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between July 21â€”July 28.

Final report assembled by [moneylegobatman](https://twitter.com/money_lego) and [ninek](https://twitter.com/_ninek_).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 37 unique vulnerabilities. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding

Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 4 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 31 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 19 non-critical recommendations and 36 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Sherlock code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock) which is comprised of 50 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 3,063 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (2)

## [[H-01] Single under-funded protocol can break paying off debt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/119)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by walker and gpersoon_

The `SherXERC20.payOffDebtAll` function iterates over all protocols of the token.
If _a single project_ does not have enough funds to cover the premium payments, the transactions come to a halt, see `_payOffDebt`:

```solidity
debt = _accruedDebt(ps, _protocol, _blocks);
// this can revert tx
ps.protocolBalance[_protocol] = ps.protocolBalance[_protocol].sub(debt);
```

Many core functions require paying off debt first and can therefore revert when a single protocol cannot pay the token premium:
- `setTokenPrice`
- `setProtocolPremium`
- `withdrawProtocolBalance`
- `redeem`
- etc.

This scenario that a protocol is unable to pay a premium does not seem unlikely especially as there can be many protocols and each protocol can pay premiums in potentially many tokens and have to continuously re-deposit to their account to increase the balance.
It is also rather involved to remove the protocol's coverage and remove the premium payments for the token. It requires governance interaction and potentially paying for the accumulated debt themselves.

 > This was a design tradeoff. As governance we can see it coming as the balance is slowly draining. But the fact the protocols are able to withdraw the full amount at any time could surprise the governance. (and make the reverts in the functions above happening)
>
> We are thinking to add a rule in the `withdrawProtocolBalance` to only allow withdrawals with at least 2 days of remaining balance. Allowing enough time for governance calls to remove the protocol.


## [[H-02] [Bug] A critical bug in `bps` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/90)
_Submitted by hrkrshnn, also found by jonah1005 and walker_

``` solidity
function bps() internal pure returns (IERC20 rt) {
  // These fields are not accessible from assembly
  bytes memory array = msg.data;
  uint256 index = msg.data.length;

  // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
  assembly {
    // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.
    rt := and(mload(add(array, index)), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)
  }
}
```

The above function is designed to expect the token at the end of `calldata`, but a malicious user can inject extra values at the end of `calldata` and fake return values.

The following contract demonstrates an example:

``` solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.6;

interface IERC20 {}

error StaticCallFailed();

contract BadEncoding {
  /// Will return address(1). But address(0) is expected!
  function f() external view returns (address) {
    address actual = address(0);
    address injected = address(1);

    (bool success, bytes memory ret) = address(this).staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(this.g.selector, actual, injected));

    if (!success) revert StaticCallFailed();

    return abi.decode(ret, (address));
  }
  function g(IERC20 _token) external pure returns (IERC20) {
    // to get rid of the unused warning
    _token;
    // Does it always match _token?
    return bps();
  }
  // From Sherlock Protocol: PoolBase.sol
  function bps() internal pure returns (IERC20 rt) {
    // These fields are not accessible from assembly
    bytes memory array = msg.data;
    uint256 index = msg.data.length;

    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
      // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.
      rt := and(mload(add(array, index)), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)
    }
  }
}
```

This example can be used to exploit the protocol:

``` solidity
function unstake(
  uint256 _id,
  address _receiver,
  IERC20 _token
) external override returns (uint256 amount) {
  PoolStorage.Base storage ps = baseData();
  require(_receiver != address(0), 'RECEIVER');
  GovStorage.Base storage gs = GovStorage.gs();
  PoolStorage.UnstakeEntry memory withdraw = ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender][_id];
  require(withdraw.blockInitiated != 0, 'WITHDRAW_NOT_ACTIVE');
  // period is including
  require(withdraw.blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown < uint40(block.number), 'COOLDOWN_ACTIVE');
  require(
    withdraw.blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown + gs.unstakeWindow >= uint40(block.number),
    'UNSTAKE_WINDOW_EXPIRED'
  );
  amount = withdraw.lock.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps)).div(ps.lockToken.totalSupply());

  ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.sub(amount);
  delete ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender][_id];
  ps.lockToken.burn(address(this), withdraw.lock);
  _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, amount);
}
```

State token `Token1`. Let's say there is a more expensive token
`Token2`.

Here's an example exploit:

``` solidity
bytes memory exploitPayload = abi.encodeWithSignature(
  PoolBase.unstake.selector,
  (uint256(_id), address(_receiver), address(Token2), address(Token1))
);
poolAddress.call(exploitPayload);
```

All the calculations on `ps` would be done on `Token2`, but at the end, because of, `_token.safeTransfer(_receiver, amount);`, `Token2` would be transferred. Assuming that `Token2` is more expensive than `Token1`, the attacker makes a profit.

Similarly, the same technique can be used at a lot of other places. Even if this exploit is not profitable, the fact that the computations can be done on two different tokens is buggy.

There are several other places where the same pattern is used. All of them needs to be fixed. I've not written an exhaustive list.

# Medium Risk Findings (4)

## [[M-01] Incorrect internal balance bookkeeping](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/12)
_Submitted by walker, also found by cmichel and shw_

The sherlock smart contract system uses internal bookkeeping of arbitrary ERC20 token balances. It doesn't assert that the ERC20 doesn't implement some non-standard behavior. For example, deflationary tokens, or tokens with a transfer fee, will result in incorrect internal balances. In summary, an attacker can perform stake and deposit actions without actually depositing the amount that sherlock assumes. As a result, an attacker is unduly rewarded balance and yield.

> Balancer had a similar vulnerability in their system https://blog.1inch.io/balancer-hack-2020-a8f7131c980e.

An example location where such internal bookkeeping happens can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/PoolBase.sol#L271)

Mitigating the issue is possible by requiring the amount to be added to the contracts' balance. Alternatively, it's possible to update the pool based on actual balance changes.

## [[M-02] `_doSherX` optimistically assumes premiums will be paid](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/107)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `_doSherX` function does not attempt to pay off the accrued premiums ("pay off debt") for most tokens, only for the ones that would otherwise revert the tx:

```solidity
// Expensive operation, only execute to prevent tx reverts
if (amounts[i] > ps.sherXUnderlying) {
  LibPool.payOffDebtAll(tokens[i]);
}
```

The `amounts = LibSherX.calcUnderlying(totalSherX)` array is an optimistic view assuming all outstanding, accrued premiums would indeed be paid until now. However, it could be that a protocol does not have enough balance to pay out these premiums and updating the state using `LibPool.payOffDebtAll(tokens[i]);` would fail for a token.

An inflated amount is then paid out to the user based on the optimistic `calcUnderlying` call.

**[Evert0x (Sherlock) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/107#issuecomment-889148550):**
 > Fair point, the protocol is optimistic the protocols can payoff their debt.

## [[M-03] reputation risks with `updateSolution`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

`GovDev.so`l has a function `updateSolution` to upgrade parts of the contract via the Diamond construction.
Via `updateSolution`, any functionality can be changed and all the funds can be accessed/rugged.
Even if this is well intended the project could still be called out resulting in a reputation risk, see for [example(https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960).

Note: there is a function `transferGovDev` which can be used to disable the `updateSolution`
```solidity
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/GovDev.sol#L25
function updateSolution(IDiamondCut.FacetCut[] memory _diamondCut,address _init,bytes memory _calldata) external override {
  require(msg.sender == LibDiamond.contractOwner(), 'NOT_DEV');
  return LibDiamond.diamondCut(_diamondCut, _init, _calldata);
}
```
Recommend applying extra safeguards for example to limit the time period where `updateSolution` can be used.

## [[M-04] Yield distribution after large payout seems unfair](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

When a large payout occurs, it will lower `unallocatedSherX`. This could mean some parties might not be able to get their Yield.

The first couple of users (for which harvest is called or which transfer tokens) will be able to get their full Yield, until the moment `unallocatedSherX` is depleted. The next users don't get any yield at all. This doesn't seem fair.

```solidity
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/SherX.sol#L309
function doYield(ILock token,address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
...
ps.unallocatedSherX = ps.unallocatedSherX.sub(withdrawable_amount);

//https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/Payout.sol#L108
 function payout( address _payout, IERC20[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _firstMoneyOut, uint256[] memory _amounts, uint256[] memory _unallocatedSherX,  address _exclude ) external override onlyGovPayout {
    // all pools (including SherX pool) can be deducted fmo and balance
    // deducting balance will reduce the users underlying value of stake token
    // for every pool, _unallocatedSherX can be deducted, this will decrease outstanding SherX rewards
    // for users that did not claim them (e.g materialized them and included in SherX pool)
....
    // Subtract from unallocated, as the tokens are now allocated to this payout call
        ps.unallocatedSherX = ps.unallocatedSherX.sub(unallocatedSherX);
```

Recommend that If `unallocatedSherX` is insufficient to provide for all the yields, only give the yields partly (so that each user gets their fair share).

 > Not only `unallocatedSherX` is subtracted but also `sWeight`, which is used to calculate the reward. I wrote some extra tests and in my experience the remaining SherX (in the unallocatedSherX variable) is splitted in a fair way.

**[Evert0x (Sherlock) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/50#issuecomment-891724441):**
 > Together with gpersoon I discussed both issue #49 and #50 and based on both findings we found a med-risk issue. In case `payout()` is called with `_unallocatedSherX > 0` and a user called `harvest()` before the payout call. It blocks the user from calling `harvest()` again. + blocks the lock token transfer.
>
> Mitigations step is to stop calling `payout()` with `_unallocatedSherX > 0`

# Low Risk Findings (31)

## [[L-01] Gov.sol: Use `SafeERC20.safeApprove` in `tokenUnload()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/51)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by eriksal1217 and shw_

This is probably an oversight since `SafeERC20` was imported and `safeTransfer()` was used for ERC20 token transfers. Nevertheless, note that `approve()` will fail for certain token implementations that do not return a boolean value (Eg. OMG and ADX tokens). Hence it is recommend to use `safeApprove()`.

Recommend updating to `_token.safeApprove(address(_native), totalToken)` in `tokenUnload()`.

## [[L-02] `withdraw` returns the final amount withdrawn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/78)
_Submitted by pauliax, also found by eriksal1217_

function `withdraw` in ILendingPool returns the actual withdrawn amount, however, function `withdraw` in AaveV2 strategy does not check this return value so e.g. function strategyWithdraw may actually withdraw less but still add the full amount to the staked balance:
```solidity
    ps.strategy.withdraw(_amount);
    ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.add(_amount);
```

Recommend that function `withdraw` in `IStrategy` should return uint indicating the actual withdrawn amount and functions that use it should account for that.

## [[L-03] series of divs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/24)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by hickuphh3 and shw_

The function `payout` contains an expression with 3 sequential divs. This is generally not recommended because it could lead to rounding errors / loss of precision. Also, a div is usually more expensive than a mul. Also, an intermediate division by 0 (if `SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply` == 0) could occur.

```solidity
//https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/Payout.sol#L108
function payout(
..
uint256 deduction =  excludeUsd.div(curTotalUsdPool.div(SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply)).div(10e17);
```

Recommend verifying the formula and replace with something like:
```solidity
uint256 deduction =  excludeUsd.mul(SherXERC20Storage.sx20().totalSupply).div(  curTotalUsdPool.mul(10e17) )
```

## [[L-04] ERC20 non-standard names](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/117)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by shw_

Usually, the functions to increase the allowance are called `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` but in `SherXERC20` they are called `increaseApproval` and `decreaseApproval`

Recommend renaming these functions to the more common names.

## [[L-05] User's `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD` value is underestimated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/144)
_Submitted by shw_

The `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD()` function of `SherX` should return `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD(getSherXBalance())` instead of `calcUnderlyingInStoredUSD(sx20.balances[msg.sender])` since there could be `SherX` unallocated to the user at the time of the function call. A similar function, `calcUnderlying()`, calculates the user's underlying tokens based on the user's current balance plus the unallocated ones.

Recommend changing `sx20.balances[msg.sender]` to `getSherXBalance()` at [L141](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/SherX.sol#L141) in `SherX.sol`.

## [[L-06] `PoolStrategy.sol`: Consider minimizing trust with implemented strategies](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by shw_

`PoolStrategy` trusts the implemented strategy `ps.strategy` (Eg. `AaveV2.sol`) to:
- return the right amount for `ps.strategy.balanceOf()`
- have sent back the withdrawn funds when `ps.strategy.withdraw()` is called
- report the correct withdrawn amount when `ps.strategy.withdrawAll()` is called

While `ps.strategy` is assumed to have been scrutinized and  its code verified before adding it as a strategy, and can therefore be trusted, consider minimizing trust between `PoolStrategy` and `ps.strategy`, since strategies are themselves reliant on other protocols and therefore subject to external risk.

- Verify the amount sent back to `PoolStrategy` for withdrawals instead
- The reliance on `balanceOf()` can be mitigated slightly by using a counter `uint256 depositedAmount` that increments / decrements upon deposits and withdrawals to the strategy respectively. This value can then be used in lieu of `ps.strategy.balanceOf()`. However, the downsides to this are that
    - this counter does not account for yield amounts from the strategy and
    - it increases complexity

A simple implementation to checking the withdrawal amounts is provided below.

```jsx
function strategyWithdraw(uint256 _amount, IERC20 _token) external override {
  ...
  uint256 balanceBefore = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
  ps.strategy.withdraw(_amount);
  require(balanceBefore.add(_amount) == _token.balanceOf(address(this)), "REASON");
  ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.add(_amount);
}

function strategyWithdrawAll(IERC20 _token) external override {
  PoolStorage.Base storage ps = baseData();
  _enforceGovPool(ps);
  _enforceStrategy(ps);

  uint256 balanceBefore = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
  ps.strategy.withdrawAll();
  // alternatively, verify amount returned by withdrawAll() method
  uint256 amount = _token.balanceOf(address(this)).sub(balanceBefore);
  ps.stakeBalance = ps.stakeBalance.add(amount);
  }
```

## [[L-07] Unbounded iteration over all premium tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/102)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Gov.protocolRemove` function iterates over all elements of the `tokensSherX` array.

The transactions could fail if the arrays get too big and the transaction would consume more gas than the block limit.
This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.

The severity is low as only governance can whitelist these tokens but not the protocols themselves.

Recommendation is to keep the array size small.

This check should still be performed even for `_token == address(this) // SHERX`, otherwise, the lock can have a different underlying and potentially pay out wrong tokens.

Recommendation is to verify the underlying of all locks.

## [[L-11] `_doSherX` does not return correct precision and it's confusing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/108)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `_doSherX` function does not return the correct precision of `sherUsd` and it is **not** the "Total amount of USD of the underlying tokens that are being transferred" that the documentation mentions.

```solidity
sherUsd = amounts[i].mul(sx.tokenUSD[tokens[i]]);
```

Instead, the amount is inflated by `1e18`, it should divide the amount by `1e18` to get a USD value with 18 decimal precision.

The severity is low as the calling site in `payout` makes up for it by dividing by `1e18` in the `deduction` computation.

We still recommend returning the correct amount in `_doSherX` already to match the documentation and avoid any future errors when using its unintuitive return value.

## [[L-12] Anyone can unstake on behalf of someone](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/114)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `PoolBase.unstakeWindowExpiry` function allows unstaking tokens of other users.
While the tokens are sent to the correct address, this can lead to issues with smart contracts that might rely on claiming the tokens themselves.

For example, suppose the `_to` address corresponds to a smart contract that has a function of the following form:
```solidity
function withdrawAndDoSomething() {
    uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    contract.unstakeWindowExpiry(address(this), id, token);
    amount = amount - token.balanceOf(address(this));
    token.transfer(externalWallet, amount)
}
```
Recommend considering that, If the contract has no other functions to transfer out funds, they may be locked forever in this contract.

So if `ps.stakeBalance` ==  ps.firstMoneyOut then `ps.stakeBalance` will not be deleted.
And then a call to tokenRemove will revert, because it checks for `ps.stakeBalance` to be 0

On several locations in the code precautions are taken not to divide by 0, because this will revert the code.
However on some locations this isn't done.

## [[L-19] unbounded loop in `getInitialUnstakeEntry` ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

The functions `getInitialUnstakeEntry` contains a for loop that can be unbounded. This would mean it could run out of gas and the function would revert.
The array `unstakeEntries` can be made arbitrarily large by repeatedly calling activateCooldown with a small amount of tokens.

The impact is very low because the array `unstakeEntries` is separated per user and links to `mgs.sender`, so you can only shoot yourself in your foot.

Additionally the function `getInitialUnstakeEntry` isn't used in the smart contracts.
```solidity
//https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/PoolBase.sol#L123
 function getInitialUnstakeEntry(address _staker, IERC20 _token)  external view  override returns (uint256)  {
...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ps.unstakeEntries[_staker].length; i++) {
      if (ps.unstakeEntries[_staker][i].blockInitiated == 0) {

function activateCooldown(uint256 _amount, IERC20 _token) external override returns (uint256) {
    require(_amount > 0, 'AMOUNT');
...
    ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender].push(PoolStorage.UnstakeEntry(uint40(block.number), _amount.sub(fee)) );
```

Recommend probably accepting the situation and add a comment in the function `getInitialUnstakeEntry`

## [[L-20] prevent burn in `_transfer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock-findings/issues/29)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

The function `_transfer` in SherXERC20.sol allow transfer to address 0.
This is usually considered the same as burning the tokens and the `Emit` is indistinguishable from an `Emit` of a burn.

However the burn function in LibSherXERC20.sol has extra functionality, which `_transfer` doesn't have.
`sx20.totalSupply = sx20.totalSupply.sub(_amount);`

So it is safer to prevent `_transfer` to address 0 (which is also done in the openzeppelin erc20 contract)
See:  https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L226

Note: minting from address 0 will not work because that is blocked by the `safemath` sub in:
 `sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);`
```solidity
https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/SherXERC20.sol#L118
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
  SherXERC20Storage.Base storage sx20 = SherXERC20Storage.sx20();
  sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);
  sx20.balances[_to] = sx20.balances[_to].add(_amount);
  emit Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
}

// https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibSherXERC20.sol#L29
function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) internal {
  SherXERC20Storage.Base storage sx20 = SherXERC20Storage.sx20();
  sx20.balances[_from] = sx20.balances[_from].sub(_amount);
  sx20.totalSupply = sx20.totalSupply.sub(_amount);
  emit Transfer(_from, address(0), _amount);
}
```

Recommend adding something like to following to `_transfer` of SherXERC20.sol:
```solidity
        require(_to!= address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");
```
Or, updating `sx20.totalSupply` if burning a desired operation.

_Submitted by pauliax_

Contract AaveV2 does not cache the lending pool, it retrieves it when necessary by calling a function `getLp()`. This is great as the implementation may change, however, this contract also approves an unlimited amount of want in the constructor:
```solidity
  ILendingPool lp = getLp();
  want.approve(address(lp), uint256(-1));
so if the implementation changes, the approval will reset. This will break the deposit function as it will try to deposit to this new lending pool with 0 approval.
```
For reference, function [`setLendingPoolImpl`](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/4b4545fb583fd4f400507b10f3c3114f45b8a037/contracts/configuration/LendingPoolAddressesProvider.sol#L58-L65).

Not sure how likely is that lending pool implementation will change so marking this as 'Low'.

Recommend that before calling `lp.deposit` check that the approval is sufficient and increase otherwise.

_Submitted by pauliax_

In Base struct having 3 separate fields that map from _protocol is error-prone. If you later introduce new fields, etc, you need not forget to delete them in function protocolRemove, etc. I think it would be better to have a separate struct for protocol-related data and map to that.

An example solution, replace:

```solidity
  mapping(bytes32 => address) protocolManagers;
  mapping(bytes32 => address) protocolAgents;
  mapping(bytes32 => bool) protocolIsCovered;
```
with:
```solidity
struct ProtocolInfo {
  address manager;
  address agent;
  bool covered;
}
struct Base {
  ...
  mapping(bytes32 => ProtocolInfo) protocolInfo;
  ...
}
```
Then you can delete all fields this way: delete `gs.protocolInfo[_protocol]`; Similar solution may be applied to `PoolStorage` (`protocolBalance`, `protocolPremium`, `isProtocol`).

Probably you are aware of this, but as I see many for loops throughout the code iterating over dynamic arrays I suggest being very careful as the execution may exceed the block gas limit, consume all the gas provided, and fail. Some arrays have removal functions, but there is, for instance, `unstakeEntries` array that is never actually removed as 'delete ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender][_id];' only resets the values to default.

You can consider introducing max limits on items in the arrays or make sure that elements can be removed from dynamic arrays in case it becomes too large.
