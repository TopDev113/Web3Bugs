About C4
--------


Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.


A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.


During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Forgeries smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between December 13—December 16 2022.

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).


Summary
=======


The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 5 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.


Additionally, C4 analysis included 28 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 24 reports recommending gas optimizations.


All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.


Scope
=====


The code under review can be found within the [C4 Forgeries contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries), and is composed of 4 smart contracts, 1 abstract, and 3 interfaces written in the Solidity programming language and includes 423 lines of Solidity code.


Severity Criteria
=================


C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.


High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:


* Malicious Input Handling
* Escalation of privileges
* Arithmetic
* Gas use


For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

On contest page:
`"If no users ultimately claim the NFT, the admin specifies a timelock period after which they can retrieve the raffled NFT."`


Let’s assume a recoverTimelock of 1 week.


The specification suggests that 1 week from the winner not having claimed the NFT. Meaning that the admin should only be able to call `lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT()` only after `<block.timestamp at fulfillRandomWords()> + request.drawTimelock + 1 weeks`.


Specification:



```
 drawTimelock recoverTimelock
 │ │
 ▼ ▼
 ┌────┬──────────────────────────────┐
 │ │ 1 week │
 └────┴──────────────────────────────┘
 ▲
 │
fulfillRandomWords()
```

* The winner should have up to `drawTimelock` to claim before an admin can call `redraw()` and pick a new winner.
* The winner should have up to `recoverTimelock` to claim before an admin can call `lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT()` to cancel the raffle.


But this is not the case.


**recoverTimelock** is set in the `initialize(...)` function and nowhere else. That means 1 week from initialization, the admin can call `lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT()`. `redraw()` also does not update `recoverTimelock`.


In fact, `startDraw()` does not have to be called at the same time as `initialize(...)`. That means that if the draw was started after having been initialized for 1 week, the admin can withdraw at any time after that.


### Impact


Protocol does not work as intended.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Just like for `drawTimelock`, `recoverTimelock` should also be updated for each dice roll.
`<block.timestamp at fulfillRandomWords()> + request.drawTimelock + <recoverBufferTime>`. Where `<recoverBufferTime>` is essentially the `drawBufferTime` currently used, but for `recoverTimelock`.


**Note:** currently, `drawTimelock` is updated in the `_requestRoll()` function. This is “technically less correct” as chainlink will take some time before `fulfillRandomWords(...)` callback. So the timelock is actually set before the winner has been chosen. This should be insignificant under normal network conditions (Chainlink VRF shouldn’t take > 1min) but both timelocks should be updated in the same function - either `_requestRoll()` or `fulfillRandomWords(...)`.

[[H-02] Draw organizer can rig the draw to favor certain participants such as their own account.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries-findings/issues/272)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries-findings/issues/272)*


In RandomDraw, the host initiates a draw using `startDraw()` or `redraw()` if the redraw draw expiry has passed. Actual use of Chainlink oracle is done in `\_requestRoll`:



```
request.currentChainlinkRequestId = coordinator.requestRandomWords({
 keyHash: settings.keyHash,
 subId: settings.subscriptionId,
 minimumRequestConfirmations: minimumRequestConfirmations,
 callbackGasLimit: callbackGasLimit,
 numWords: wordsRequested
});
```

Use of subscription API is explained well [here](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription). Chainlink VRFCoordinatorV2 is called with `requestRandomWords()` and emits a random request. After `minimumRequestConfirmations` blocks, an oracle VRF node replies to the coordinator with a provable random, which supplies the random to the requesting contract via `fulfillRandomWords()` call. It is important to note the role of subscription ID. This ID maps to the subscription charged for the request, in LINK tokens. In our contract, the raffle host supplies their subscription ID as a parameter. Sufficient balance check of the request ID is not [checked](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/286a65065fcfa5e1b2362745079cdc218e40e68d/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L370) at request-time, but rather checked in Chainlink [node](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/806ee17236ba70926a1f07d1141808b634db48b6/core/services/vrf/listener_v2.go#L346) code as well as on-chain by [VRFCoordinator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/286a65065fcfa5e1b2362745079cdc218e40e68d/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L594) when the request is satisfied. In the scenario where the subscriptionID lacks funds, there will be a period of 24 hours when user can top up the account and random response will be [sent](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription):


“Each subscription must maintain a minimum balance to fund requests from consuming contracts. If your balance is below that minimum, your requests remain pending for up to 24 hours before they expire. After you add sufficient LINK to a subscription, pending requests automatically process as long as they have not expired.”


The reason this is extremely interesting is because as soon as redraws are possible, the random response can no longer be treated as fair. Indeed, Draw host can wait until redraw cooldown passed (e.g. 1 hour), and only then fund the subscriptionID. At this point, Chainlink node will send a TX with the random response. If host likes the response (i.e. the draw winner), they will not interfere. If they don’t like the response, they can simply frontrun the Chainlink TX with a `redraw()` call. A redraw will create a new random request and discard the old requestId so the previous request will never be accepted.



```
function fulfillRandomWords(
 uint256 \_requestId,
 uint256[] memory \_randomWords
) internal override {
 // Validate request ID
 // <---------------- swap currentChainlinkRequestId --->
 if (\_requestId != request.currentChainlinkRequestId) {
 revert REQUEST\_DOES\_NOT\_MATCH\_CURRENT\_ID();
 }
 ...
}
```



```
//<------ redraw swaps currentChainlinkRequestId --->
request.currentChainlinkRequestId = coordinator.requestRandomWords({
 keyHash: settings.keyHash,
 subId: settings.subscriptionId,
 minimumRequestConfirmations: minimumRequestConfirmations,
 callbackGasLimit: callbackGasLimit,
 numWords: wordsRequested
});
```

Chainlink docs [warn](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/security) against this usage pattern of the VRF -“Don’t accept bids/bets/inputs after you have made a randomness request”. In this instance, a low subscription balance allows the host to invalidate the assumption that 1 hour redraw cooldown is enough to guarantee Chainlink answer has been received.


### Impact


Draw organizer can rig the draw to favor certain participants such as their own account.


### Proof of Concept


Owner offers a BAYC NFT for holders of their NFT collection X. Out of 10,000 tokenIDs, owner has 5,000 Xs. Rest belongs to retail users.


1. Owner subscriptionID is left with 0 LINK balance in coordinator
2. Redraw time is set to 2 hours
3. Owner calls `startDraw()` which will initiate a Chainlink request
4. Owner waits for 2 hours and then tops up their subscriptionID with sufficient LINK
5. Owner scans the mempool for `fulfillRandomWords()`
6. If the raffle winner is tokenID < 5000, it is owner’s token


	1. Let fulfill execute and pick up the reward
7. If tokenID >= 5000


	1. Call `redraw()`
	2. fulfill will revert because of requestId mismatch
8. Owner has 75% of claiming the NFT instead of 50%


Note that Forgeries draws are presumably intended as incentives for speculators to buy NFTs from specific collections. Without having a fair shot at receiving rewards from raffles, these NFTs user buys could be worthless. Another way to look at it is that the impact is theft of yield, as host can freely decrease the probability that a token will be chosen for rewards with this method.


Also, I did not categorize it as centralization risk as the counterparty is not Forgeries but rather some unknown third-party host which offers an NFT incentive program. It is a similar situation to the distinction made between 1st party and 3rd party projects [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-juicebox-findings/issues/191).


### Tools Used


[Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription)


[Chainlink co-ordinator code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol)


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


The root cause is that Chainlink response can arrive up to 24 hours from the most request is dispatched, while redraw cooldown can be 1 hour+. The best fix would be to enforce minimum cooldown of 24 hours.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L173>

### Impact


The raffle creator is not required to actually give the NFT away. The NFT that is used for the raffle is transferred to the contract when `startDraw` is executed. Before that, the NFT is in the hands of the creator. This means that he might create a raffle to make users buy NFTs required to participate and then refuse to draw a winner and keep the NFT to himself. Furthermore, he might not even be the owner of the NFT in the first place, which he can achieve by flash loaning the NFT in order to pass the `ownerOf` check in `initialize` function.


### Proof of Concept


**Example 1**


1. User U creates an NFT collection C
2. He buys a BAYC NFT
3. He creates a raffle with it, and requires `drawingToken` to be from collection C
4. Users buy tokens from his collection C
5. He then refuses to execute `startDraw` function and rather sells the BAYC NFT


**Example 2**


1. User U creates an NFT collection C
2. User U uses an NFT flash loan to borrow a very expensive NFT
3. In the same transaction he creates a raffle with this NFT, and requires `drawingToken` to be from collection C
4. The check that he is the owner will pass, because for the duration of the transaction he in fact is
5. Users see that there is a raffle for a very expensive NFT, so they buy tokens C
6. The winner is never drawn, because the creator does not even own the NFT


**Example 3**


1. User U has an NFT X
2. He puts X on a sale on some NFT marketplace (which does not require him to lock it in contract)
3. He forgets about it and creates a raffle with it
4. Users buy the tokens necessary for the raffle
5. User U wants to execute the `startDraw` function, but just before it the NFT X is bought from him through the marketplace
6. The winner cannot be drawn


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Transfer the NFT to the contract at the time of creation of the raffle. You can do that by approving the factory contract to transfer the token and do the transfer in [`makeNewDraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.sol#L43) function between cloning and `initialization`.



```
address newDrawing = ClonesUpgradeable.clone(implementation);
IERC721(settings.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, newDrawing, settings.tokenId);
 // Setup the new drawing
IVRFNFTRandomDraw(newDrawing).initialize(admin, settings);
```

Remember to remove token transfer from `startDraw` function.


Notice that the creator can still claim NFT after a week, without drawing, by executing `lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT`. To prevent that, I would recommend adding a check in [`lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L304), if a winner was drawn.



```
 if (!request.hasChosenRandomNumber) {
 revert NEEDS\_TO\_HAVE\_CHOSEN\_A\_NUMBER();
}
```

So now a user can trust that the NFT is locked in the contract, and it will be claimable only by a winner (or creator if the winner does not claim it). However, there is still no guarantee that the winner will actually be drawn, because the creator has to manually execute `startDraw` function.
To fix this, I would recommend allowing anyone to execute `startDraw` function, so there is no need to rely on the creator. But we would need to limit the time window of when [`startDraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L173) can be executed, so users have the time to get tokens before the drawing. That can be done by introducing a new state variable `firstDrawTime`, that acts as a timestamp after which drawing can happen.



```
if(block.timestamp < firstDrawTime) revert CANNOT\_DRAW\_YET();
```

Notice that now the NFT can only be claimed after the winner has been drawn. This means that we are depending on ChainLink VRF to be successful. For that reason I would recommend adding a role that has the power to change the VRF subscription or restore the NFT in cases where the winner is not picked in reasonable time. This role would be given to protocol owner (owner of the factory) / DAO / someone who would be considered as most reliable.

### Impact


The admin/owner of `VRFNFTRandomDraw` can `startDraw()` a raffle, including emitting the `SetupDraw` event, but in a way that ensures `fulfillRandomWords()` is never called. For example:


* `keyHash` is not validated within `coordinator.requestRandomWords()`. Providing an invalid `keyHash` will allow the raffle to start but prevent the oracle from actually supplying a random value to determine the raffle result.


	+ <https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/00f9c6e41f843f96108cdaa118a6ca740b11df35/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L407-L409>

* The admin/owner could alternatively ensure that the owner-provided chain.link VRF subscription does not have sufficient funds to pay at the time the oracle attempts to supply random values in `fulfillRandomWords()`.


	+ <https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/00f9c6e41f843f96108cdaa118a6ca740b11df35/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol#L594-L596>


In addition, the owner/admin could simply avoid ever calling `startDraw()` in the first place.


### Proof of Concept


Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Depending on the desired functionality with respect to the raffle owner, a successful callback to `fulfillRandomWords()` could be a precondition of the admin/owner reclaiming the reward NFT. This would help ensure the owner does not create raffles that they intend will never pay out a reward.

In `VRFNFtRandomDraw\.sol initialize()`, the MONTH*IN*SECONDS variable is used to validate two values:


* configured time between redraws is under 1 month
* recoverTimelock (when NFT can be returned to owner) is less than 1 year in the future




```
if (\_settings.drawBufferTime > MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS) {
 revert REDRAW\_TIMELOCK\_NEEDS\_TO\_BE\_LESS\_THAN\_A\_MONTH();
}
...
if (
 \_settings.recoverTimelock >
 block.timestamp + (MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS \* 12)
) {
 revert RECOVER\_TIMELOCK\_NEEDS\_TO\_BE\_LESS\_THAN\_A\_YEAR();
}
```

The issue is that MONTH*IN*SECONDS is calculated incorrectly:



```
/// @dev 60 seconds in a min, 60 mins in an hour
uint256 immutable HOUR\_IN\_SECONDS = 60 \* 60;
/// @dev 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week
uint256 immutable WEEK\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7);
// @dev about 30 days in a month
uint256 immutable MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7) \* 30;
```

MONTH*IN*SECONDS multiplies by 7 incorrectly, as it was copied from WEEK*IN*SECONDS. Therefore, actual seconds calculated is equivalent of 7 months.
Therefore, recoverTimelock can be up to a non-sensible value of 7 years, and re-draws every up to 7 months.


### Impact


Protocol safeguards for time durations are skewed by a factor of 7. Protocol may potentially lock NFT for period of 7 years.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Fix MONTH*IN*SECONDS calculation:
`uint256 immutable MONTH_IN_SECONDS = (3600 * 24) * 30;`

Low Risk Issues Summary
-----------------------




| Number | Issues Details | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [L-01] | `redraw()` should be called by anyone | 1 |
| [L-02] | An `owner` can resign and lead to locked NFT | 1 |
| [L-03] | NFTs are not guaranteed to have sequential IDs | 1 |


Total: 3 issues


[L-01] `redraw()` should be called by anyone
--------------------------------------------


[VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L203-L225](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L203-L225) 


Redrawing a raffle already protects the winner through the timelocking mechanism. Dependency on the owner should be avoidable in this instance by removing the modifier `onlyOwner`, allowing anyone to redraw the raffle.


[L-02] An owner can resign and lead to locked NFTs
--------------------------------------------------


Since there’s a possibility of unclaimed drafts, the owner is the only one able to rescue the prize NFT from the raffle contract. Thus, having the ability to resign ownership (including non-intentional) could lead to stuck NFTs.


Consider altering or removing [resignOwnership](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/ownable/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L112-L116) method: 



```
 /// @notice Resign ownership of contract
 /// @dev only callably by the owner, dangerous call.
 function resignOwnership() public onlyOwner {
 \_transferOwnership(address(0));
 }
```

[L-03] NFTs are not guaranteed to have sequential IDs
-----------------------------------------------------


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L71-L90>


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L249-L256>


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L271>


### Impact


Accordingly to [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721):



> 
> **NFT Identifiers**
> 
> 
> Every NFT is identified by a unique uint256 ID inside the ERC-721 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair (contract address, uint256 tokenId) will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. While some ERC-721 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, **callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a “black box”.** Also note that NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumeration functions for a supported enumeration interface.
> 
> 
> The choice of uint256 allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to uint256.
>

This project, aims to create a raffle [specifying](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L71-L90) that the potential winner will be between a range, where the lower limit is set by the candidate with the lowest TokenId and the candidate with the highest TokenId (`+1` to be included in the draw) sets the upper limit. As stated in the previous quote, this could generate gigantic ranges with numerous empty tokens given how it is [calculated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L249-L256) (see [ENS](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85#readContract) as an example of empty slots and how the ids [are generated](https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/ens-as-nft)).


After generating the random number via VRF, the winner [is selected by](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L249-L256) *moduluing* by the range plus the initial token id. The result is then used to determine [the winner](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L271). 


Considering the costs to query VRF and the waiting time to claim the prize, this issue may turn the contract unusable. 


Note that any used method when casting the collection to IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable has the same effect as casting to IERC721, and giving how a raffle is setup, it seems the original intent was to use indexes instead of ids.


External requirements:


* non-sequential NFTs.


### Proof of Concept


Consider a scenario where:



```
Drawing NFT Collection: ABC
TokenIDs: [1,10,1000]
TotalSupply: 3
```

Setting a raffle to include each possible token results in [1..1001[ alternatives. Since there are only three possible winners, there’s only `0.3%` of a successful draw.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Depending on the direction the project takes:


1. Change the way the setup is performed;
2. Give more guarantees that only collections with sequential ids are used (note that the same problem might happen in nfts with high number of burns);
3. Only use indexed collections.


Non-Critical Issues Summary

| [N-10] | `drawingTokenEndId` should be inclusive or altered to a range | 1 |
| [N-11] | `fulfillRandomWords` must not revert | 1 |


Total: 11 issues


[N-01] `getRequestDetails()` should include the tokenid
-------------------------------------------------------


In [VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#getRequestDetails()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L58-L70) should include `currentChosenTokenId` ([at](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L63)) and ease integrations with other tools.


[N-02] Avoid setting time variables manually
--------------------------------------------


Use solidity [Time Units](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/units-and-global-variables.html#time-units) to avoid mistakes in defining time variables. In [VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L28-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L28-L33) (the `MONTH_IN_SECONDS` leads to a medium issue): 



```
/// @dev 60 seconds in a min, 60 mins in an hour
uint256 immutable HOUR\_IN\_SECONDS = 60 \* 60;
/// @dev 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week
uint256 immutable WEEK\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7);
// @dev about 30 days in a month
uint256 immutable MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7) \* 30;
```

Consider changing to:



```
/// @dev 60 seconds in a min, 60 mins in an hour
uint256 immutable HOUR\_IN\_SECONDS = 1 hours;
/// @dev 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week
uint256 immutable WEEK\_IN\_SECONDS = 1 weeks;
// @dev about 30 days in a month
uint256 immutable MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS = 30 days;
```

[N-03] Use constants instead of immutable variables
---------------------------------------------------


Variables defined in [VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L21-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L21-L33) should be constants, since they aren’t defined at contract creation:



```
 uint32 immutable callbackGasLimit = 200\_000;
 /// @notice Chainlink request confirmations, left at the default
 uint16 immutable minimumRequestConfirmations = 3;
 /// @notice Number of words requested in a drawing
 uint16 immutable wordsRequested = 1;

 /// @dev 60 seconds in a min, 60 mins in an hour
 uint256 immutable HOUR\_IN\_SECONDS = 60 \* 60;
 /// @dev 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week
 uint256 immutable WEEK\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7);
 // @dev about 30 days in a month
 uint256 immutable MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7) \* 30;
```

If these are rules, consider changing them to `IVRFNFTRandomDraw` interface:



```
 uint32 constant callbackGasLimit = 200\_000;
 /// @notice Chainlink request confirmations, left at the default
 uint16 constant minimumRequestConfirmations = 3;
 /// @notice Number of words requested in a drawing
 uint16 constant wordsRequested = 1;

 /// @dev 60 seconds in a min, 60 mins in an hour
 uint256 constant HOUR\_IN\_SECONDS = 60 \* 60;
 /// @dev 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week

 // @dev about 30 days in a month
 uint256 constant MONTH\_IN\_SECONDS = (3600 \* 24 \* 7) \* 30;
```

[N-04] Uppercase immutable variables
------------------------------------


In [VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L22-L26](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L22-L26):



```

```

In [VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L37):



```

```

In [Version.sol#L5](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/utils/Version.sol#L5):



```

```

```
 address public immutable implementation;
```

[N-05] Empty blocks should be avoided
-------------------------------------


Avoid using code blocks, such as:


In [VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.sol#L53-L59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.sol#L53-L59):



```
 /// @notice Allows only the owner to upgrade the contract
 /// @param newImplementation proposed new upgrade implementation
 function \_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
 internal
 override
 onlyOwner
 {}
```

Consider emitting an event.


[N-06] Missing *NatSpec*
------------------------


Consider adding specification to the following code blocks:


In [IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L28](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L28):



```
 error REDRAW\_TIMELOCK\_NEEDS\_TO\_BE\_LESS\_THAN\_A\_MONTH();
```

[N-07] Contracts that extend interfaces should override its methods
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Consider using the `override` keyword to indicate which methods are implementing the interface.


For `VRFNFTRandomDraw` regarding `IVRFNFTRandomDraw`: `initialize`, `startDraw`, `redraw`, `hasUserWon`, `winnerClaimNFT`, `lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT`, `getRequestDetails`.
For `VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory` regarding `IVRFNFTRandomDrawFactory`: `initialize`, `startDraw`.


[N-08] `_requestRoll()` after confirming that the raffle is viable
------------------------------------------------------------------


In [startDraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L173-L198), the contract makes a request for a random number before confirming that it has the prize to raffle. 


Consider confirming first that the contract has the NFT to raffle before wasting resources calling for a random.


[N-09] `IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable` may lead to false assumptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Throughout the [contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol), there’s a wrapper of NFT collections to `IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable` instances:



```
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:127: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(\_settings.token).ownerOf(
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:187: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(settings.token).transferFrom(
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:216: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(settings.token).ownerOf(
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:271: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(settings.drawingToken).ownerOf(
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:295: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(settings.token).transferFrom(
src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol:315: IERC721EnumerableUpgradeable(settings.token).transferFrom(
```

This could lead to false assumptions when working with this contract (particularly when considering how settings are defined).


Consider altering to `IERC721` if the goal is to allow any NFT collection compliant with EIP-721.


[N-10] `drawingTokenEndId` should be inclusive or altered to a range
--------------------------------------------------------------------


[Natspec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L80-L81) specifies that the last ID is exclusive in the raffle, but the variable’s name could lead to wrong assumptions. 


Consider altering the logic to the contract to include the ID or to change the logic to a range definition, since it is only used twice ([1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L249),[2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L113-L114)) and could avoid misinterpretations.


[N-11] `fulfillRandomWords` must not revert
-------------------------------------------


Accordingly to ChainLinks’ documentation:



> 
> `fulfillRandomWords` must not revert
> If your `fulfillRandomWords()` implementation reverts, the VRF service will not attempt to call it a second time. Make sure your contract logic does not revert. Consider simply storing the randomness and taking more complex follow-on actions in separate contract calls made by you, your users, or an Automation Node.
> 
> 
> 


This project’s current implementation does revert [in two instances](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L230-L260), although they are not expected to materialize.


Nevertheless, consider altering the logic to drop the random generated whenever the requestId does not match and ignore extra words if the array received is greater than the expected amount.

Gas Optimizations Overview
--------------------------


NB: Some functions have been truncated where necessary to just show affected parts of the code. 


Throughout the report some places might be denoted with audit tags to show the actual place affected.


I’ve tried to give the exact amount of gas saved from running the included tests. Whenever the function is within the test coverage, the average gas before and after will be included, and often a diff of the code will also accompany this.


Some functions are not covered by the test cases or are internal/private functions. In this case, the gas can be estimated by looking at the opcodes involved. 


[G-01] Pack structs by putting data types in ascending size (We can save up to ~6k gas)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As the solidity EVM works with 32 bytes, variables less than 32 bytes should be packed inside a struct so that they can be stored in the same slot, this saves gas when writing to storage ~20000 gas.


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L59-L68>


### We can use a smaller type for uint256 drawTimelock as it’s simply a timestamp. Using uint64 should be safe for 532 years. We save 1 Storage SLOT from 4 SLOTS to 3 SLOTS (~2K gas)



```

### We can save 2 SLOTs here by packing address token with uint64 subscriptionId and also changing the type of uint256 recoverTimelock which is a timestamp to uint64 which should be safe for more than 500 years (Saves ~4k gas)

[G-02] Emitting storage values instead of the memory one.

[G-03] Cache storage values in memory to minimize SLOADs
--------------------------------------------------------


The code can be optimized by minimizing the number of SLOADs.


SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L141-L169>

[G-05] Using unchecked blocks to save gas
-----------------------------------------


Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isn’t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block.


[See resource](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695).


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L112-L115>


### Saves 43 gas on average




|  | Min | Average | Median | Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before | 43790 | 146546 | 175523 | 192923 |
| After | 43790 | 146503 | 175451 | 192851 |

The operation `_settings.drawingTokenEndId - _settings.drawingTokenStartId` cannot underflow as it would only be performed if the operation `_settings.drawingTokenEndId < _settings.drawingTokenStartId` is false(Short circuit rules)

[G-08] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
--------------------------------------------------------------------


If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. 


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.sol#L21>



```
File: /src/VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.sol
21: address public immutable implementation;
```

[G-09] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.The extra opcodes avoided costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
