# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Livepeer contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 13â€”January 19 2022.

## Wardens

31 Wardens contributed reports to the Livepeer contest:

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 20 unique vulnerabilities and 82 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 8 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 11 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 24 non-critical recommendations and 38 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Livepeer contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer), and is composed of 16 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1928 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] [WP-H5] `L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()` does not send `bridgeMinter`'s ETH to L2 causing ETH get frozen in the contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/205)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by gzeon, harleythedog, and Ruhum_.

Per the `arb-bridge-eth` code:

> all msg.value will deposited to callValueRefundAddress on L2

- <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/78118ba205854374ed280a27415cb62c37847f72/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L313>

- <https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1ArbitrumMessenger.sol#L65-L74>

```solidity
uint256 seqNum = inbox.createRetryableTicket{value: _l1CallValue}(
    target,
    _l2CallValue,
    maxSubmissionCost,
    from,
    from,
    maxGas,
    gasPriceBid,
    data
);
```

At L308-L309, ETH held by `BridgeMinter` is withdrawn to L1Migrator:

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L308-L309>

```solidity
uint256 amount = IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr)
    .withdrawETHToL1Migrator();
```

However, when calling `sendTxToL2()` the parameter `_l1CallValue` is only the `msg.value`, therefore, the ETH transferred to L2 does not include any funds from `bridgeMinter`.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L318-L327>

```solidity
sendTxToL2(
    l2MigratorAddr,
    address(this), // L2 alias of this contract will receive refunds
    msg.value,
    amount,
    _maxSubmissionCost,
    _maxGas,
    _gasPriceBid,
    ""
)
```

As a result, due to lack of funds, `call` with value = amount to `l2MigratorAddr` will always fail on L2.

Since there is no other way to send ETH to L2, all the ETH from `bridgeMinter` is now frozen in the contract.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
sendTxToL2(
    l2MigratorAddr,
    address(this), // L2 alias of this contract will receive refunds
    msg.value + amount, // the `amount` withdrawn from BridgeMinter should be added
    amount,
    _maxSubmissionCost,
    _maxGas,
    _gasPriceBid,
    ""
)
```

# Medium Risk Findings (8)
## [[M-01] L1Migrator.migrateLPT` can be used to take away protocol's access to LPT tokens in BridgeMinter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/97)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by gzeon and harleythedog_.

Same thing as the ETH issue I reported earlier. I wasn't sure if those are supposed to be a single issue or not. The concept is the same. But, now you lose LPT tokens.

The `L1Migrator.migrateLPT()` function can be called by **anyone**. It pulls all the LPT from the `BridgeMinter` contract and starts the process of moving the funds to L2. First of all, this function is only executable once. The RetryableTicket created with the first call is the only chance of moving the funds to L2.

The attacker can call the function with [parameters](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1\_l2\_messages#parameters) that make the creation of the RetryableTicket on L2 fail. Thus, the LPT sits in the L1Migrator contract with no way of moving it to L2 or anywhere else. Effectively, the funds are lost.

#### Proof of Concept

The function is only executable once because it uses the `amount` returned by `IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawLPTToL1Migrator()` to specify the amount of LPT to be sent to L2: <https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/main/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L342>

After the first call to `migrateLPT()` that function will always return 0 since the `BridgeMinter` won't have any more LPT: <https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/streamflow/contracts/token/BridgeMinter.sol#L107>

So after the attacker called `migrateLPT()` with insufficient funds to create a RetryableTicket on L2 we have the following state:

*   BridgeMinter has 0 LPT
*   L1Migrator has X amount of LPT that is not accessible. There are no functions to get the LPT out of there.
*   1 failed RetryTicket

The same thing can also be triggered by a non-malicious caller by simply providing insufficient funds. The whole design of only being able to try once is the issue here.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of using the `amount` returned by `IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawLPTToL1Migrator()` you should use the balance of the `L1Migrator` contract.

It might also make sense to **not** allow anybody to call the function. I don't see the benefit of that.

Actually, the funds aren't lost. The funds are sent to the Escrow contract which can be used to transfer the funds back to the BridgeMinter contract. Thus, you could reset the whole thing to its initial state and call `L1Migrator.migrateLPT()` again. But, a really persistent attacker has the ability to DoS the function by frontrunning any call to it which results in the RetryableTicket failing again. Thus, you'd have to transfer the funds from the Escrow contract to the BrigeMinter again and so on.

So the same scenario I've outlined earlier is still viable. It's just a bit more difficult now since it has a higher cost for the attacker now. Because of that I think it's an medium issue instead of high.

Also, the mitigation steps I've given aren't valid. You can't use the `L1Migrator` contract's balance since it will always be 0 (the funds are sent to the Escrow contract). Thus the best solution would be to just limit the access to the function.

## [[M-02] [WP-H3] `L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()` Improper implementation of `L1Migrator` causing `migrateETH()` always reverts, can lead to ETH in `BridgeMinter` getting stuck in the contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/198)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by gzeon_.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1Migrator.sol#L308-L310>

```solidity
uint256 amount = IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawETHToL1Migrator();
```

`L1Migrator.sol#migrateETH()` will call `IBridgeMinter(bridgeMinterAddr).withdrawETHToL1Migrator()` to withdraw ETH from `BridgeMinter`.

However, the current implementation of `L1Migrator` is unable to receive ETH.

<https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/20e7ebb86cdb4fe9285bf5fea02eb603e5d48805/contracts/token/BridgeMinter.sol#L94-L94>

```solidity
(bool ok, ) = l1MigratorAddr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
```

A contract receiving Ether must have at least one of the functions below:

*   `receive() external payable`
*   `fallback() external payable`

`receive()` is called if `msg.data` is empty, otherwise `fallback()` is called.

Because `L1Migrator` implement neither `receive()` or `fallback()`, the `call` at L94 will always revert.

#### Impact

All the ETH held by the `BridgeMinter` can get stuck in the contract.

#### Recommendation

Add `receive() external payable {}` in `L1Migrator`.

## [[M-03] Fund loss when insufficient call value to cover fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/238)
_Submitted by gzeon_.

Fund can be lost if the L1 call value provided is insufficient to cover `_maxSubmissionCost`, or stuck if insufficient to cover `_maxSubmissionCost + (_maxGas * _gasPriceBid)`.

#### Proof of Concept

`outboundTransfer` in `L1LPTGateway` does not check if the call value is sufficient, if it is `< _maxSubmissionCost` the retryable ticket creation will fail and fund is lost; if it is `<_maxSubmissionCost + (_maxGas * _gasPriceBid)` the ticket would require manual execution.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/gateway/L1LPTGateway.sol#L80>
```solidity
function outboundTransfer(
    address _l1Token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _maxGas,
    uint256 _gasPriceBid,
    bytes calldata _data
) external payable override whenNotPaused returns (bytes memory) {
    require(_l1Token == l1Lpt, "TOKEN_NOT_LPT");

    // nested scope to avoid stack too deep errors
    address from;
    uint256 seqNum;
    bytes memory extraData;
    {
        uint256 maxSubmissionCost;
        (from, maxSubmissionCost, extraData) = parseOutboundData(_data);
        require(extraData.length == 0, "CALL_HOOK_DATA_NOT_ALLOWED");

        // transfer tokens to escrow
        TokenLike(_l1Token).transferFrom(from, l1LPTEscrow, _amount);

        bytes memory outboundCalldata = getOutboundCalldata(
            _l1Token,
            from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            extraData
        );

        seqNum = sendTxToL2(
            l2Counterpart,
            from,
            maxSubmissionCost,
            _maxGas,
            _gasPriceBid,
            outboundCalldata
        );
    }

    emit DepositInitiated(_l1Token, from, _to, seqNum, _amount);

    return abi.encode(seqNum);
}
```
#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add check similar to the one used in `L1GatewayRouter` provided by Arbitrum team

<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/b8366005a697000dda1f57a78a7bdb2313db8fe2/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L236>
```solidity
uint256 expectedEth = _maxSubmissionCost + (_maxGas * _gasPriceBid);
require(_maxSubmissionCost > 0, "NO_SUBMISSION_COST");
require(msg.value == expectedEth, "WRONG_ETH_VALUE");
```

 > Labeled as disagree with severity because we think this is a 2 - Med finding. We think that the likelihood of this occurring is low because in almost all cases users should be interacting with this contract using an application that handles calculating the maxSubmissionCost properly which would prevent the reported issue. However, we do think that the impact *if* this occurs is high since LPT *and* ETH could be lost if the reported issue happens. Thus, we think 2 - Med is appropriate given that assets are not at direct risk, but there is a low probability path for assets to be lost.

## [[M-04] [WP-M0] `MINTER_ROLE` can be granted by the deployer of L2LivepeerToken and mint arbitrary amount of tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/193)
_Submitted by WatchPug_.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/token/LivepeerToken.sol#L23-L30>

```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)
    external
    override
    onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
{
    _mint(_to, _amount);
    emit Mint(_to, _amount);
}
```

Using the `mint()` function of `L2LivepeerToken`, an address with `MINTER_ROLE` can burn an arbitrary amount of tokens.

If the private key of the deployer or an address with the `MINTER_ROLE` is compromised, the attacker will be able to mint an unlimited amount of LPT tokens.

We believe this is unnecessary and poses a serious centralization risk.

#### Recommendation

Consider removing the `MINTER_ROLE`, make the `L2LivepeerToken` only mintable by the owner, and make the L2Minter contract to be the owner and therefore the only minter.

**[yondonfu (Livepeer) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/193#issuecomment-1019660423):**

## [[M-05] [WP-M1] `BURNER_ROLE` can burn any amount of L2LivepeerToken from an arbitrary address](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/194)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cccz_.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/token/LivepeerToken.sol#L36-L43>

```solidity
function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount)
    external
    override
    onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE)
{
    _burn(_from, _amount);
    emit Burn(_from, _amount);
}
```

Using the `burn()` function of `L2LivepeerToken`, an address with `BURNER_ROLE` can burn an arbitrary amount of tokens from any address.

We believe this is unnecessary and poses a serious centralization risk.

A malicious or compromised `BURNER_ROLE` address can take advantage of this, burn the balance of a Uniswap pool and effectively steal almost all the funds from the liquidity pool (eg, Uniswap LPT-WETH Pool).

#### Recommendation

Consider removing the `BURNER_ROLE` and change `burn()` function to:

```solidity
function burn(uint256 _amount)
    external
    override
{
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    emit Burn(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/49cf5401b0514511675d781a1e29d6b0325cfe88/contracts/L2/gateway/L2LPTGateway.sol#L34-L45>

`Mintable(l2Lpt).burn(from, _amount);` in `L2LPTGateway.sol#outboundTransfer()` should also be replaced with:

```solidity
Mintable(l2Lpt).transferFrom(from, _amount);
Mintable(l2Lpt).burn(_amount);
```

## [[M-06] [WP-M2] `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can approve arbitrary address to spend any amount from the `L1Escrow` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/195)
_Submitted by WatchPug_.

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/escrow/L1Escrow.sol#L21-L28>

```solidity
function approve(
    address _token,
    address _spender,
    uint256 _value
) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    ApproveLike(_token).approve(_spender, _value);
    emit Approve(_token, _spender, _value);
}
```

`L1Escrow.sol#approve()` allows an address with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can approve an arbitrary amount of tokens to any address.

We believe this is unnecessary and poses a serious centralization risk.

A malicious or compromised `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` address can take advantage of this, and steal all the funds from the `L1Escrow` contract.

#### Recommendation

Consider removing `approve()` function and approve `l1LPT` to `l1Gateway` in the constructor.

## [[M-07] [WP-M4] Unable to use `L2GatewayRouter` to withdraw LPT from L2 to L1, as `L2LPTGateway` does not implement `L2GatewayRouter` expected method](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/202)
_Submitted by WatchPug_.

Per the document: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer#l2---l1-lpt-withdrawal>

> The following occurs when LPT is withdrawn from L2 to L1:

> The user initiates a withdrawal for X LPT. This can be done in two ways: a. Call outboundTransfer() on L2GatewayRouter which will call outboundTransfer() on L2LPTGateway b. Call outboundTransfer() directly on L2LPTGateway

The method (a) described above won't work in the current implementation due to the missing interface on `L2LPTGateway`.

When initiate a withdraw from the Arbitrum Gateway Router, `L2GatewayRouter` will call `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)` on `ITokenGateway(gateway)`:

            _to,
            _amount,
            _maxGas,
            _gasPriceBid,
            gatewayData
        );
}
```

However, `L2LPTGateway` dose not implement `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)` but only `outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)`:

<https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L2/gateway/L2LPTGateway.sol#L65-L89>

```solidity
function outboundTransfer(
    address _l1Token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override whenNotPaused returns (bytes memory res) {
    // ...
}
```

Therefore, the desired feature to withdraw LPT from L2 to L1 via Arbitrum Router will not be working properly.

#### Recommendation

Consider implementing the method used by  Arbitrum Router.

**[yondonfu (Livepeer) confirmed and resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/202#issuecomment-1026222951):**
 > Fixed in https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/pull/57



## [[M-08] Admin can rug L2 Escrow tokens leading to reputation risk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-livepeer-findings/issues/165)
_Submitted by harleythedog_.

The `L1Escrow` contract has the function `approve` that is callable by the admin to approve an arbitrary spender with an arbitrary amount (so they can steal all of the escrow's holdings if they want). Even if the admin is well intended, the contract can still be called out which would degrade the reputation of the protocol (e.g. see here: <https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960>). LPT is valuable on the Ethereum mainnet, so this rug vector should be mitigated. It would be best to restrict this function's power by only allowing approvals to other trusted protocol contracts (like L1LPTGateway, which I believe uses the escrow's approval).

NOTE: Even if the admin is under a timelock, this is still an issue, as users have to wait a whole week to withdraw from L2 -> L1 due to the dispute period.

#### Proof of Concept

See the `approve` function [here](https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/ebf68d11879c2798c5ec0735411b08d0bea4f287/contracts/L1/escrow/L1Escrow.sol#L21)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Restrict the power of this `approve` function so that the admin isn't able to steal funds. This can be accomplished by only allowing approvals to other protocol functions (instead of arbitrary approvals).
