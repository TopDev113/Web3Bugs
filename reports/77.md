# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of ElasticSwap contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 20—January 26 2022.

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] In the case of Single Asset Entry, new liquidity providers will suffer fund loss due to wrong formula of ΔRo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap-findings/issues/144)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

### Current Implementation

#### When `baseToken` rebase up

Per the document: <https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap/blob/a90bb67e2817d892b517da6c1ba6fae5303e9867/ElasticSwapMath.md#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20alphaDecay>

and related code: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L227-L283>

`Gamma` is the ratio of shares received by the new liquidity provider when `addLiquidity()` (ΔRo) to the new totalSupply (total shares = Ro' = Ro + ΔRo).

    ΔRo = (Ro/(1 - γ)) * γ

            Ro * Gamma
        = --------------
             1 - Gamma
    ⟺
    ΔRo * ( 1 - Gamma ) = Gamma * Ro
    ΔRo - Gamma * ΔRo = Gamma * Ro
    ΔRo = Gamma * Ro + Gamma * ΔRo
               ΔRo    
    Gamma = ---------
             Ro + ΔRo 

In the current implementation:

    γ = ΔY / Y' / 2 * ( ΔX / α^ )

ΔY is the `quoteToken` added by the new liquidity provider. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L277>

Y' is the new Y after `addLiquidity()`, `Y' = Y + ΔY`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L272>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L278>

ΔX is `ΔY * Omega`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L259-L263>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L279>

α^ is `Alpha - X`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L234-L235>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L280>

For instance:

Given:

*   Original State: X = Alpha = 1, Y = Beta = 1, Omega = X/Y = 1
*   When `baseToken` rebase up: Alpha becomes 10
*   Current State: Alpha = 10, X = 1, Y = Beta = 1, Omega = 1

When: new liquidity provider `addLiquidity()` with 4 quoteToken:

                 4          4 * Omega      16
    Gamma = ------------ * ------------ = ----
             (1+4) * 2       10 - 1        90

After `addLiquidity()`:

*   baseToken belongs to the newLP: 10 \* 16 / 90 = 160 / 90 = 1.7777777777777777
*   quoteToken belongs to the newLP: (1+4) \* 16 / 90 = 80 / 90 = 0.8888888888888888
*   In the terms of `quoteToken`, the total value is: 160 / 90 / Omega + 80 / 90 = 240 / 90 = 2.6666666666666665

As a result, the new liquidity provider suffers a fund loss of `4 - 240 / 90 = 1.3333333333333333 in the terms of quoteToken`

The case above can be reproduced by changing the numbers in [this test unit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/test/exchangeTest.js#L1804).

#### When `baseToken` rebase down

Per the document: <https://github.com/ElasticSwap/elasticswap/blob/a90bb67e2817d892b517da6c1ba6fae5303e9867/ElasticSwapMath.md#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20betaDecay>

and related code: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L297-L363>

`Gamma` is the ratio of shares received by the new liquidity provider when `addLiquidity()` (ΔRo) to the new totalSupply (total shares = Ro' = Ro + ΔRo).

    ΔRo = (Ro/(1 - γ)) * γ

            Ro * Gamma
        = --------------
             1 - Gamma
    ⟺
    ΔRo * ( 1 - Gamma ) = Gamma * Ro
    ΔRo - Gamma * ΔRo = Gamma * Ro
    ΔRo = Gamma * Ro + Gamma * ΔRo
               ΔRo    
    Gamma = ---------
             Ro + ΔRo 

In the current implementation:

    γ = ΔX / X / 2 * ( ΔXByQuoteTokenAmount / β^ )

ΔX is the amount of `baseToken` added by the new liquidity provider. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L357>

X is the balanceOf `baseToken`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L358>

ΔXByQuoteTokenAmount is ΔX / Omega, the value of ΔX in the terms of `quoteToken`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L318-L322>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L329-L333>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L359>

β^ is maxΔX / Omega, the value of maxΔX in the terms of `quoteToken`. `maxΔX = X - Alpha`. See:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L304-L305>

For instance:

Given:

*   Original State: X = Alpha = 10, Y = Beta = 10, Omega = X/Y = 1
*   When `baseToken` rebase down, Alpha becomes 1
*   Current State: Alpha = 1, X = 10, Y = Beta = 10, Omega = 1

When: new liquidity provider `addLiquidity()` with `4 baseToken`

                4          4 / Omega       8
    Gamma = -------- * ---------------- = ----
              10 * 2    (10-1) / Omega     90

After `addLiquidity()`:

*   baseToken belongs to the newLP: (1 + 4) \* 8 / 90 = 40 / 90 = 0.4444444444444444
*   quoteToken belongs to the newLP: 10 \* 8 / 90 = 80 / 90 = 0.8888888888888888
*   In the terms of quoteToken, the total value is: 40 / 90 + 80 / 90 \* Omega = 120 / 90 = 1.3333333333333333 < 4

As a result, the new liquidity provider suffers a fund loss of `4 - 120 / 90 = 2.6666666666666665 in the terms of quoteToken`

The case above can be reproduced by changing the numbers in [this test unit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/test/exchangeTest.js#L2146).

### The correct formula for ΔRo

[See issue page for details.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap-findings/issues/144)


### Recommendation

Update code and document using the correct formula for ΔRo.

## [[H-02] Transferring `quoteToken` to the exchange pool contract will cause future liquidity providers to lose funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap-findings/issues/146)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

In the current implementation, the amount of LP tokens to be minted when `addLiquidity()` is calculated based on the ratio between the amount of newly added `quoteToken` and the current wallet balance of `quoteToken` in the `Exchange` contract.

However, since anyone can transfer `quoteToken` to the contract, and make the balance of `quoteToken` to be larger than `_internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty`, existing liquidity providers can take advantage of this by donating `quoteToken` and make future liquidity providers receive fewer LP tokens than expected and lose funds.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L578-L582>

```solidity
liquidityTokenQty = calculateLiquidityTokenQtyForDoubleAssetEntry(
    _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens,
    quoteTokenQty,
    _quoteTokenReserveQty // IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this))
);
```

### PoC

Given:

*   The `Exchange` pool is new;

1.  Alice `addLiquidity()` with `1e18 baseToken` and `1e18 quoteToken`, recived `1e18` LP token;
2.  Alice transfer `99e18 quoteToken` to the `Exchange` pool contract;
3.  Bob `addLiquidity()` with `1e18 baseToken` and `1e18 quoteToken`;
4.  Bob `removeLiquidity()` with all the LP token in balance.

**Expected Results**: Bob recived `1e18 baseToken` and >= `1e18 quoteToken`.

**Actual Results**: Bob recived \~`0.02e18 baseToken` and \~`1e18 quoteToken`.

Alice can now `removeLiquidity()` and recive \~`1.98e18 baseToken` and \~`100e18 quoteToken`.

As a result, Bob suffers a fund loss of `0.98e18 baseToken`.

### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
liquidityTokenQty = calculateLiquidityTokenQtyForDoubleAssetEntry(
    _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens,
    quoteTokenQty,
    _internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty
);
```

# Medium Risk Findings (1)
## [[M-01] The value of LP token can be manipulated by the first minister, which allows the attacker to dilute future liquidity providers' shares](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap-findings/issues/145)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by camden, danb, and hyh_

For the first minter of an Exchange pool, the ratio of `X/Y` and the `totalSupply` of the LP token can be manipulated.

A sophisticated attacker can mint and burn all of the LP tokens but `1 Wei`, and then artificially create a situation of rebasing up by transferring baseToken to the pool contract. Then `addLiquidity()` in `singleAssetEntry` mode.

Due to the special design of `singleAssetEntry` mode, the value of LP token can be inflated very quickly.

As a result, `1 Wei` of LP token can be worthing a significate amount of baseToken and quoteToken.

Combine this with the precision loss when calculating the amount of LP tokens to be minted to the new liquidity provider, the attacker can turn the pool into a trap which will take a certain amount of cut for all future liquidity providers by minting fewer LP tokens to them.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L493-L512>

```solidity
} else {
    // this user will set the initial pricing curve
    require(
        _baseTokenQtyDesired > 0,
        "MathLib: INSUFFICIENT_BASE_QTY_DESIRED"
    );
    require(
        _quoteTokenQtyDesired > 0,
        "MathLib: INSUFFICIENT_QUOTE_QTY_DESIRED"
    );

    tokenQtys.baseTokenQty = _baseTokenQtyDesired;
    tokenQtys.quoteTokenQty = _quoteTokenQtyDesired;
    tokenQtys.liquidityTokenQty = sqrt(
        _baseTokenQtyDesired * _quoteTokenQtyDesired
    );

    _internalBalances.baseTokenReserveQty += tokenQtys.baseTokenQty;
    _internalBalances.quoteTokenReserveQty += tokenQtys.quoteTokenQty;
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-elasticswap/blob/d107a198c0d10fbe254d69ffe5be3e40894ff078/elasticswap/src/libraries/MathLib.sol#L204-L212>

```solidity
function calculateLiquidityTokenQtyForDoubleAssetEntry(
    uint256 _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens,
    uint256 _quoteTokenQty,
    uint256 _quoteTokenReserveBalance
) public pure returns (uint256 liquidityTokenQty) {
    liquidityTokenQty =
        (_quoteTokenQty * _totalSupplyOfLiquidityTokens) /
        _quoteTokenReserveBalance;
}
```

### PoC

Given:

*   The `Pool` is newly created;
*   The market price of `baseToken` in terms of `quoteToken` is `1`.

The attacker can do the following steps in one tx:

1.  `addLiquidity()` with `2 Wei of baseToken` and `100e18 quoteToken`, received `14142135623` LP tokens;
2.  `removeLiquidity()` with `14142135622` LP tokens, the Pool state becomes:

*   totalSupply of LP tokens: 1 Wei
*   baseTokenReserveQty: 1 Wei
*   quoteTokenReserveQty: 7071067813 Wei

3.  `baseToken.transfer()` 7071067812 Wei to the Pool contract;
4.  `addLiquidity()` with no baseToken and `50e18 quoteToken`;
5.  `swapBaseTokenForQuoteToken()` with `600000000000000 baseToken`, the Pool state becomes:

*   totalSupply of LP tokens: 1 Wei
*   quoteTokenReserveQty 591021750159032
*   baseTokenReserveQty 600007071067801

6.  `baseToken.transfer()` 999399992928932200 Wei to the Pool contract;
7.  `addLiquidity()` with no baseToken and `1e18 quoteToken`, the Pool state becomes:

*   totalSupply of LP tokens: 1 Wei
*   quoteTokenReserveQty: 1000000000000000013
*   quoteTokenReserveQty: 985024641638342212
*   baseTokenDecay: 0

From now on, `addLiquidity()` with less than `1e18` of `baseToken` and `quoteToken` will receive `0` LP token due to precision loss.

The amounts can be manipulated to higher numbers and cause most future liquidity providers to receive fewer LP tokens than expected, and the attacker will be able to profit from it as the attacker will take a larger share of the pool than expected.

### Recommendation

Consider requiring a certain amount of minimal LP token amount (eg, 1e8) for the first minter and lock some of the first minter's LP tokens by minting \~1% of the initial amount to the factory address.

 > I agree with the finding and remember coming across it when reading the [Yearn V0.4.2 Audit by Trails of Bits.](https://docs.yearn.finance/security/index#third-party-audits)
> 
> Ultimately this is contingent on a donation, that will make each share more valuable, so it's effectively a way to use rounding against making dust donations.
> 
> Technically this same idea can be extended to huge donations, however there are very dubious economic reasons as to why you'd do that (perhaps frontrunning a moderate deposit with the goal of using this method to earn that MEV).
> 
> Ultimately this is something that can happen anytime you have X shares and Y totalSupply
> If the total supply reaches greater units than the shares, then integer division will inevitably eat out some of those shares.
> 
> Have yet to see a long term solution to this rounding problem, however, a simple initial addition that mints 1e18 shares will require some economic commitment by the potential exploiters.
> 
> Agree with medium severity.
