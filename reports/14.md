# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of PoolTogether smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between June 16—June 23.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 30 unique vulnerabilities. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding

Of these vulnerabilities, 5 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 7 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 18 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 6 non-critical recommendations and 34 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 PoolTogether code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether) is comprised of 10 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,395 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (5)

## [[H-01] User could lose underlying tokens when redeeming from the `IdleYieldSource`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/120)
_Submitted by shw_

The `redeemToken` function in `IdleYieldSource` uses `redeemedShare` instead of `redeemAmount` as the input parameter when calling `redeemIdleToken` of the Idle yield source. As a result, users could get fewer underlying tokens than they should.

When burning users' shares, it is correct to use `redeemedShare` (line 130). However, when redeeming underlying tokens from Idle Finance, `redeemAmount` should be used instead of `redeemedShare` (line 131). Usually, the `tokenPriceWithFee()` is greater than `ONE_IDLE_TOKEN`, and thus `redeemedShare` is less than `redeemAmount`, causing users to get fewer underlying tokens than expected.

Recommend changing `redeemedShare` to `redeemAmount` at line [L131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/IdleYieldSource.sol#L129-L131).

## [[H-02] `YearnV2YieldSource` wrong subtraction in withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/90)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xRajeev_

When withdrawing from the `vault`, one redeems `yTokens` for `token`s, thus the `token` balance of the contract should increase after withdrawal.
But the contract subtracts the `currentBalance` from the `previousBalance`:

```solidity
uint256 yShares = _tokenToYShares(amount);
uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
// we accept losses to avoid being locked in the Vault (if losses happened for some reason)
if(maxLosses != 0) {
    vault.withdraw(yShares, address(this), maxLosses);
} else {
    vault.withdraw(yShares);
}
uint256 currentBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
// @audit-issue this seems wrong
return previousBalance.sub(currentBalance);
```

All vault withdrawals fail due to the integer underflow as the `previousBalance` is less than `currentBalance`. Users won't be able to get back their investment.

Recommend that It should return `currentBalance > previousBalance ? currentBalance - previousBalance : 0`

## [[H-03] `BadgerYieldSource` `balanceOfToken` share calculation seems wrong](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/84)
_Submitted by cmichel_

When suppling to the `BadgerYieldSource`, some `amount` of `badger` is deposited to `badgerSett` and one receives `badgerSett` share tokens in return which are stored in the `balances` mapping of the user. So far this is correct.

The `balanceOfToken` function should then return the redeemable balance in `badger` for the user's `badgerSett` balance.
It computes it as the pro-rata share of the user balance (compared to the total-supply of `badgerSett`) on the `badger` in the vault:

```solidity
balances[addr].mul(
  badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))
).div(
  badgerSett.totalSupply()
)
```

However, `badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))` is only a small amount of badger that is deployed in the vault ("Sett") due to most of the capital being deployed to the _strategies_. Therefore, it under-reports the actual balance:

> Typically, a Sett will keep a small portion of deposited funds in reserve to handle small withdrawals cheaply. [Badger Docs](https://badger-finance.gitbook.io/badger-finance/technical/setts/sett-contract)

Any contract or user calling the `balanceOf` function will receive a value that is far lower than the actual balance.
Using this value as a basis for computations will lead to further errors in the integrations.

Recommend using [`badgerSett.balance()`](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-system/blob/2b0ee9bd77a2cc6f875b9b984ae4dfe713bbc55c/contracts/badger-sett/Sett.sol#L126) instead of `badger.balanceOf(address(badgerSett))` to also account for "the balance in the Sett, the Controller, and the Strategy".

## [[H-04] withdraw timelock can be circumvented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/91)
_Submitted by cmichel_

One can withdraw the entire `PrizePool` deposit by circumventing the timelock.
Assume the user has no credits for ease of computation:
- user calls `withdrawWithTimelockFrom(user, amount=userBalance)` with their entire balance. This "mints" an equivalent `amount` of `timelock` and resets `_unlockTimestamps[user] = timestamp = blockTime + lockDuration`.
- user calls `withdrawWithTimelockFrom(user, amount=0)` again but this time withdrawing `0` amount. This will return a `lockDuration` of `0` and thus `unlockTimestamp = blockTime`. The inner `_mintTimelock` now resets `_unlockTimestamps[user] = unlockTimestamp`
- As `if (timestamp <= _currentTime()) ` is true, the full users amount is now transferred out to the user in the `_sweepTimelockBalances` call.

Users don't need to wait for their deposit to contribute their fair share to the prize pool.
They can join before the awards and leave right after without a penalty which leads to significant issues for the protocol.
It's the superior strategy but it leads to no investments in the strategy to earn the actual interest.

Recommend that the unlock timestamp should be increased by duration each time, instead of being reset to the duration.

## [[H-05] `IdleYieldSource` doesn't use mantissa calculations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/103)
_Submitted by tensors_

Because mantissa calculations are not used in this case to account for decimals, the arithmetic can zero out the number of shares or tokens that should be given.

For example, say I deposit 1 token, expecting 1 share in return. On [L95](https://github.com/sunnyRK/IdleYieldSource-PoolTogether/blob/6dcc419e881a4f0f205c07c58f4db87520b6046d/contracts/IdleYieldSource.sol#L95), if the `totalUnderlyingAssets` is increased to be larger than the number of total shares, then the division would output 0 and I wouldn't get any shares.

Recommend  implementing mantissa calculations like in the contract for the AAVE  yield.

# Medium Risk Findings (7)

## [[M-01] `safeApprove()` for Yearn Vault may revert preventing deposits causing DoS](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/71)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by pauliax_

The `_depositInVault()` function for Yearn yield source uses ERC20 `safeApprove()` from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library to give maximum allowance to the Yearn Vault address if the current allowance is less than contract’s token balance.

However, the `safeApprove` function prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. It reverts if that is the case. Instead, the `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` functions should be used. Comment from the OZ library for this function:
> “// `safeApprove` should only be called when setting an initial allowance, // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and ‘safeDecreaseAllowance'"

If the existing allowance is non-zero (say, for e.g., previously the entire balance was not deposited due to vault balance limit resulting in the allowance being reduced but not made 0), then `safeApprove()` will revert causing the user’s token deposits to fail leading to denial-of-service. The condition predicate indicates that this scenario is possible. See [similar Medium-severity finding M03](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/1inch-exchange-audit/).

Recommend using `safeIncreaseAllowance()` function instead of `safeApprove()`.

## [[M-02] Return values of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` are unchecked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/112)
_Submitted by shw, gpersoon, JMukesh, also found by a_delamo and cmichel_

In the contracts `BadgerYieldSource` and `SushiYieldSource`, the return values of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` are not checked to be `true`, which could be `false` if the transferred tokens are not ERC20-compliant (e.g., `BADGER`). In that case, the transfer fails without being noticed by the calling contract.

If warden's understanding of the `BadgerYieldSource` is correct, the `badger` variable should be the `BADGER` token at address `0x3472a5a71965499acd81997a54bba8d852c6e53d`. However, this implementation of `BADGER` is not ERC20-compliant, which returns `false` when the sender does not have enough token to transfer (both for `transfer` and `transferFrom`). See the [source code on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3472a5a71965499acd81997a54bba8d852c6e53d#code) (at line 226) for more details.

Recommend using the [`SafeERC20` library implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) from Openzeppelin and call `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` when transferring ERC20 tokens.

## [[M-03] `SafeMath` not completely used in yield source contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/114)
_Submitted by shw, also found by cmichel_

`SafeMath` is not completely used at the following lines of yield source contracts, which could potentially cause arithmetic underflow and overflow:
1. [line 78](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/SushiYieldSource.sol#L78) in `SushiYieldSource`
2. [line 67](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/BadgerYieldSource.sol#L67) in `BadgerYieldSource`
3. line [91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/IdleYieldSource.sol#L91) and [98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/yield-source/IdleYieldSource.sol#L98) in `IdleYieldSource`

Recommend using the `SafeMath` library functions in the above lines.

## [[M-04] The assumption that operator == to (user) may not hold leading to failed timelock deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/51)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The contract uses `_msgSender()` to denote an operator who is operating on behalf of the user. This is typically used for meta-transactions where the operator is an intermediary/relayer who may facilitate gas-less transactions on behalf of the user. They may be the same address but it is safer to assume that they may not be.

While the code handles this separation of role in most cases, it misses doing so in `timelockDepositTo()` function where it accounts the `_timelockBalances` to the operator address instead of the user specified `to` address. It assumes they are the same. The corresponding usage in `_mintTimelock()` which is called from `withdrawWithTimelockFrom()` uses the user specified 'from' address and not the `_msgSender()`. Therefore the corresponding usage in `timelockDepositTo()` should be the same.

In the scenario where the operator address != user specified from/to addresses, i.e. meta-transactions, the timelock deposits and withdrawals are made to/from different addresses and so the deposits of timelocked tokens will fail because the operator’s address does not have the required amount of `_timelockBalances`.

Recommend changing `operator` to `from` on [L281](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L281) of `timelockDepositTo()` and specifying the scenarios where the role of the operator is applicable and document/implement those accordingly.

## [[M-05] Actual yield source check on address will succeed for non-existent contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/59)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

Low-level calls `call`/`delegatecall`/`staticcall` return true even if the account called is non-existent (per EVM design). [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions) warns:
> "The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.”

The `staticcall` here will return True even if the `_yieldSource` contract doesn't exist at any incorrect-but-not-zero address, e.g. EOA address, used during initialization by accident.

The hack, as commented, to check if it’s an actual yield source contract, will fail if the address is indeed a contract account which doesn’t implement the `depositToken` function. However, if the address is that of an EOA account, the check will pass here but will revert in all future calls to the yield source forcing contract redeployment after the pool is active. Users will not be able to interact with the pool and abandon it.

Recommend that a contract existence check should be performed on `_yieldSource` prior to the depositToken function existence hack for determining yield source contract.

## [[M-06] `YieldSourcePrizePool_canAwardExternal` does not work](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/92)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The idea of `YieldSourcePrizePool_canAwardExternal` seems to be to disallow awarding the interest-bearing token of the yield source, like aTokens, cTokens, yTokens.

> "@dev Different yield sources will hold the deposits as another kind of token: such a Compound's cToken.  The prize strategy should not be allowed to move those tokens."

However, the code checks `_externalToken != address(yieldSource)` where `yieldSource` is the actual yield strategy contract and not the strategy's interest-bearing token.
Note that the `yieldSource` is usually not even a token contract except for `ATokenYieldSource` and `YearnV2YieldSource`.

The `_canAwardExternal` does not work as expected. It might be possible to award the interest-bearing token which would lead to errors and loss of funds when trying to redeem underlying.

There doesn't seem to be a function to return the interest-bearing token. It needs to be added, similar to `depositToken()` which retrieves the underlying token.

## [[M-07] Using `transferFrom` on ERC721 tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/115)
_Submitted by shw_

In the function `awardExternalERC721` of contract `PrizePool`, when awarding external ERC721 tokens to the winners, the `transferFrom` keyword is used instead of `safeTransferFrom`. If any winner is a contract and is not aware of incoming ERC721 tokens, the sent tokens could be locked.

Recommend consider changing `transferFrom` to `safeTransferFrom` at line 602. However, it could introduce a DoS attack vector if any winner maliciously rejects the received ERC721 tokens to make the others unable to get their awards. Possible mitigations are to use a `try/catch` statement to handle error cases separately or provide a function for the pool owner to remove malicious winners manually if this happens.

# Low Risk Findings (18)

## [[L-01] no check for `_stakeToken`!=0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

The `initializeYieldSourcePrizePool` function of `YieldSourcePrizePool.sol` has a check to make sure `_yieldSource` !=0. However, the `initialize` function  of the comparable `StakePrizePool.sol` doesn't do this check.

Although unlikely this will introduce problems, it is more consistent to check for 0.

[`YieldSourcePrizePool.sol` L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/YieldSourcePrizePool.sol#L24)
```solidity
  function initializeYieldSourcePrizePool (... IYieldSource _yieldSource) ... {
..
  require(address(_yieldSource) != address(0), "YieldSourcePrizePool/yield-source-zero");
  PrizePool.initialize(
```

[`StakePrizePool.sol` L20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/StakePrizePool.sol#L20)
```solidity
function initialize ( ..  IERC20Upgradeable _stakeToken)...  {
  PrizePool.initialize(
```

Recommend adding something like the following in the initialize function of `StakePrizePool.sol`:
```solidity
  require(address(_stakeToken) != address(0), "StakePrizePool/stakeToken-zero");
```

## [[L-02] Lack of `nonReentrant` modifier in yield source contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/119)
_Submitted by shw, also found by gpersoon, 0xRajeev and pauliax__

The `YearnV2YieldSource` contract prevents the `supplyTokenTo`, `redeemToken`, and `sponsor` functions from being reentered by applying a `nonReentrant` modifier. Since these contracts share a similar logic, adding a `nonReentrant` modifier to these functions in all of the yield source contracts is reasonable. However, the same protection is not seen in other yield source contracts.

A `nonReentrant` modifier in the following functions is missing:
1. The `sponsor` function of `ATokenYieldSource`
2. The `supplyTokenTo` and `redeemToken` function of `BadgerYieldSource`
3. The `sponsor` function of `IdleYieldSource`
4. The `supplyTokenTo` and `redeemToken` function of `SushiYieldSource`

Recommend adding a `nonReentrant` modifier to these functions. For `BadgerYieldSource` and `SushiYieldSource` contracts, make them inherit from Openzeppelin's `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` to use the `nonReentrant` modifier.

## [[L-03] What is default duration when `creditRateMantissa` is not set](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/10)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

In `PrizePool.sol`, if the value of  `_tokenCreditPlans[_controlledToken].creditRateMantissa` isn't set (yet), then the function `_estimateCreditAccrualTime` returns 0.
This means the `TimelockDuration` is 0 and funds can be withdrawn immediately, defeating the entire timelock mechanism.

Recommend perhaps a different default would be useful.

[`PrizePool.sol` L783](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L783)
```solidity
function _estimateCreditAccrualTime( address _controlledToken,uint256 _principal,uint256 _interest ) internal view returns (uint256 durationSeconds)  {
  uint256 accruedPerSecond = FixedPoint.multiplyUintByMantissa(_principal, _tokenCreditPlans[_controlledToken].creditRateMantissa);
  if (accruedPerSecond == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  return _interest.div(accruedPerSecond);
}
```

[`PrizePool.sol` L710](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/main/contracts/PrizePool.sol#L710)
```solidity
function _calculateTimelockDuration( address from, address controlledToken, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 durationSeconds, uint256 burnedCredit )  {
...
  uint256 duration = _estimateCreditAccrualTime(controlledToken, amount, exitFee);
  if (duration > maxTimelockDuration) {
    duration = maxTimelockDuration;
  }
  return (duration, _burnedCredit);
}
```

Recommend considering the default duration for the case `_tokenCreditPlans[_controlledToken].creditRateMantissa` isn't set.

## [[L-04] `staticCall` to `yieldSource.depositToken` doesn't provide any security guarantees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/14)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo_

The assumption that a yield source is valid, just because it has the method `depositToken`, is not a security guarantee. I could create any random contract with that function but that is not a guarantee that the contract will behave as intended.

I believe a better solution would be to have a registry, controlled by governance, that accepts the valid yield sources. A valid registry ensures the the yield sources are properly maintained.

In summary: There is no security difference between having the check and not having the check, because the check can be sidelined without any effort and doesn’t truly provide any guarantee of the contract being valid. Having no checks would save you gas. While having a governance registry would guarantee that the yield sources usable are exclusively the community vetted ones.

## [[L-05] Switch modifier order to consistently place the non-reentrant modifier as the first one](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

If a function has multiple modifiers they are executed in the order specified. If checks or logic of modifiers depend on other modifiers this has to be considered in their ordering. `PrizePool` has functions with multiple modifiers with one of them being non-reentrant which prevents reentrancy on the functions. This should ideally be the first one to prevent even the execution of other modifiers in case of re-entrancies.

While there is no obvious vulnerability currently with non-reentrant being the last modifier in the list, it is safer to place it in the first. This is of slight concern with the deposit functions which have the `canAddLiquidity()` modifier (before non-reentrant) that makes external calls to get `totalSupply` of controlled tokens.

For reference, see similar finding in [Consensys’s audit of Balancer](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/05/balancer-finance/#switch-modifier-order-in-bpool).

Recommend switching modifier order to consistently place the non-reentrant modifier as the first one to run so that all other modifiers are executed only if the call is non-reentrant.

## [[L-06] Missing modifier `onlyControlledToken` may result in undefined/exceptional behavior](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/54)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The modifier `onlyControlledToken` is used for functions that allow the `controlledToken` address as a parameter to ensure that only whitelisted tokens (ticket and sponsorship) are provided. This is used in all functions except `calculateEarlyExitFee()`.

The use of a non-whitelisted `controlledToken` will result in calls to potentially malicious token contract and cause undefined behavior for the `from` user address specified in the call.

Recommend adding missing modifier `onlyControlledToken` to `calculateEarlyExitFee()`.

## [[L-07] Missing calls to `init` functions of inherited contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/60)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by shw_

Most contracts use the `delegateCall` proxy pattern and hence their implementations require the use of `initialize()` functions instead of constructors. This requires derived contracts to call the corresponding `init` functions of their inherited base contracts. This is done in most places except a few.

The inherited base classes do not get initialized which may lead to undefined behavior.
- Missing call to `__ReentrancyGuard_init` in `ATokenYieldSource.sol` [L99-L102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/yield-source/ATokenYieldSource.sol#L99-L102) and [L59-L61](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether/blob/85f8d044e7e46b7a3c64465dcd5dffa9d70e4a3e/contracts/yield-source/IdleYieldSource.sol#L59-L61)

## [[L-08] Unlocked pragma used in multiple contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/109)
_Submitted by shw, also found by 0xRajeev and JMukesh_

Some contracts (e.g., `PrizePool`) use an unlocked pragma (e.g., `pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.7.0;`) which is not fixed to a specific Solidity version. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using a different compiler version with which they have been tested the most.

Please use `grep -R pragma .` to find the unlocked pragma statements.

Recommend locking pragmas to a specific Solidity version. Consider the compiler bugs in the following lists and ensure the contracts are not affected by them. It is also recommended to use the latest version of Solidity when deploying contracts (see [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/#solidity)).

Solidity compiler bugs:

## [[L-09] Missing zero-address checks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/65)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization or during setting is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in all address variable initializations.

Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables.

Recommend adding zero-address checks for all initializations of address state variables.

## [[L-10] Overly permissive threshold check allows high yield loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/69)
_Submitted by0xRajeev_

The Yearn yield source defines `maxLosses` as: “Max % of losses that the Yield Source will accept from the Vault in BPS” and uses a setter `setMaxLosses()` to allow owner to set this value. However, the threshold check implemented only checks if this value is less than 10_000 or 100%, which is a good sanity check but allows loss of even 100%. The buffer for the loss is to avoid funds being locked in the Yearn vault in any emergency situation.

If the losses are really high for some reason, it will impact the interest and the prizes.

Perform a tighter upper threshold check to allow a more acceptable max loss value in `setMaxLosses()`

## [[L-11] Ignored return values may lead to undefined behavior](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/70)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The `_depositInVault()` returns the value returned from its call to the Yearn vault’s `deposit()` function. However, the return value is ignored at both call sites in `supplyTokenTo()` and `sponsor()`.

 It is unclear what the intended usage is and how, if any, the return value should be checked. This should perhaps check how much of the full balance was indeed deposited/rejected in the vault by comparing the return value of issued vault shares as commented: “The actual amount of shares that were received for the deposited tokens” because "if deposit limit is reached, tokens will remain in the Yield Source and they will be queued for retries in subsequent deposits.”

Recommend checking return value appropriately or if not, document why this is not necessary.

## [[L-12] Using `memory[]` parameter without checking its length](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/75)
_Submitted by JMukesh_

Using memory array parameters (e.g.` uint[]` memory) as function parameters can be tricky in Solidity, because an attack is possible with a very large array which will overlap with other parts of the memory.

This an example to show the exploit based on [`Exploit.sol`](https://github.com/paradigm-operations/paradigm-ctf-2021/blob/master/swap/private/Exploit.sol):
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24; // only works with low solidity version

contract test{
    struct Overlap {
        uint field0;
    }
    event log(uint);

  function mint(uint[] memory amounts) public  returns (uint) {   // this can be in any solidity version
       Overlap memory v;
       v.field0 = 1234;
       emit log(amounts[0]); // would expect to be 0 however is 1234
       return 1;
     }

  function go() public { // this part requires the low solidity version
      uint x=0x800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000; // 2^251
      bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSelector(this.mint.selector, 0x20, x);
      bool success=address(this).call(payload);
  }
}
```

Recommend checking the array length before using it

_Submitted by cmichel_

Some parameters of functions are not checked for invalid values:
- `StakePrizePool.initialize`: `address _stakeToken` not checked for non-zero or contract
- `ControlledToken.initialize`: `address controller` not checked for non-zero or contract
- `PrizePool.withdrawReserve`: `address to` not checked for non-zero, funds will be lost when sending to zero address
- `ATokenYieldSource.initialize`: `address _aToken, _lendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry` not checked for non-zero or contract
- `BadgerYieldSource.initialize`: `address badgerSettAddr, badgerAddr` not checked for non-zero or contract
- `SushiYieldSource.constructor`: `address _sushiBar, _sushiAddr` not checked for non-zero or contract

Wrong user input or wallets defaulting to the zero addresses for a missing input can lead to the contract needing to redeploy or wasted gas.

Recommend validating the parameters.

## [[L-15] `ATokenYieldSource` mixes aTokens and underlying when redeeming](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `ATokenYieldSource.redeemToken` function burns `aTokens` and sends out underlying; however, it's used in a reverse way in the code:
The `balanceDiff` is used as the `depositToken` that is transferred out but it's computed on the **aTokens** that were burned instead of on the `depositToken` received.

It should not directly lead to issues as aTokens are 1-to-1 with their underlying but we still recommend doing it correctly to make the code more robust against any possible rounding issues.

Recommend computing `balanceDiff` on the underyling balance (`depositToken`), not on the aToken. Then, subtract the actual burned aTokens from the user shares.

The `PrizePool` contract does not implement the `onERC721Received` function, which is considered a best practice to transfer ERC721 tokens from contracts to contracts. The absence of this function could prevent `PrizePool` from receiving ERC721 tokens from other contracts via `safeTransferFrom`.

## [[L-18] Lack of event emission after critical `initialize()` functions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/68)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

Most contracts use `initialize()` functions instead of constructor given the `delegatecall` proxy pattern. While most of them emit an event in the critical `initialize()` functions to record the init parameters for off-chain monitoring and transparency reasons, `Ticket.sol` nor its base class `ControlledToken.sol` emit such an event in their `initialize()` functions.

These contracts are initialized but their critical init parameters (name, symbol, decimals and controller address) are not logged for any off-chain monitoring.

See similar [Medium-severity Finding M01](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-audit-phase-4/) in OpenZeppelin’s audit of UMA protocol.

Recommend emitting an initialized event in `Ticket.sol` and `ControlledToken.sol` logging their init parameters.

**[dmvt (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether-findings/issues/68#issuecomment-907507066):**
 > I'm going to split the difference here. Events are important for various reasons.
