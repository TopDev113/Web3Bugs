# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of a critical component of the Behodler Ecosystem. The code contest took place between January 27—February 2, 2022 with a specific focus on the Limbo smart contract system.

## Wardens

# High Risk Findings (7)
## [[H-01] Lack of access control on `assertGovernanceApproved` can cause funds to be locked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/300)
_Submitted by shw, also found by kirk-baird and pauliax_

Lack of access control on the `assertGovernanceApproved` function of `FlashGovernanceArbiter` allows anyone to lock other users' funds in the contract as long as the users have approved the contract to transfer `flashGovernanceConfig.amount` of `flashGovernanceConfig.asset` from them.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice wants to execute a flash governance decision (e.g., disable to the protocol), so she first calls `approve` on the `flashGovernanceConfig.asset` to allow `FlashGovernanceArbiter` to transfer `flashGovernanceConfig.amount` of assets from her.
2.  An attacker Bob, who listens to the mempool, notices Alice's `approve` transaction and decides to front-run it. He calls `assertGovernanceApproved` with `sender` being Alice, `target` being any address, and `emergency` being `true`.
3.  As a result, Alice cannot execute her flash governance decision, and her funds are locked in the contract for the `flashGovernanceConfig.unlockTime` period.

Referenced code:
[DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60-L81](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60-L81)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only allow certain addresses to call the `assertGovernanceApproved` function on `FlashGovernanceArbiter`.

## [[H-03] Double transfer in the `transferAndCall` function of `ERC677`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/302)
_Submitted by shw, also found by cccz, danb, and wuwe1_

The implementation of the `transferAndCall` function in `ERC677` is incorrect. It transfers the `_value` amount of tokens twice instead of once. Since the `Flan` contract inherits `ERC667`, anyone calling the `transferAndCall` function on `Flan` is affected by this double-transfer bug.

#### Proof of Concept

Below is the implementation of `transferAndCall`:
```solidity
function transferAndCall(
  address _to,
  uint256 _value,
  bytes memory _data
) public returns (bool success) {
  super.transfer(_to, _value);
  _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
  if (isContract(_to)) {
      contractFallback(_to, _value, _data);
  }
  return true;
}
```

We can see that `super.transfer(_to, _value);` and `_transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` are doing the same thing - transfering `_value` of tokens from `msg.sender` to `_to`.

Referenced code:
[ERC677/ERC677.sol#L28-L29](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/ERC677/ERC677.sol#L28-L29)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove `_transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` in the `transferAndCall` function.

## [[H-04] Logic error in `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` can cause locked assets to be stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/305)
_Submitted by shw_

A logic error in the `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function that resets a user's `pendingFlashDecision` allows that user to steal other user's assets locked in future flash governance decisions. As a result, attackers can get their funds back even if they execute a malicious flash decision and the community burns their assets.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  An attacker Alice executes a malicious flash governance decision, and her assets are locked in the `FlashGovernanceArbiter` contract.
2.  The community disagrees with Alice's flash governance decision and calls `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` to burn her locked assets. However, the `burnFlashGovernanceAsset` function resets Alice's `pendingFlashDecision` to the default config (see line 134).
3.  A benign user, Bob executes another flash governance decision, and his assets are locked in the contract.
4.  Now, Alice calls `withdrawGovernanceAsset` to withdraw Bob's locked asset, effectively the same as stealing Bob's assets. Since Alice's `pendingFlashDecision` is reset to the default, the `unlockTime < block.timestamp` condition is fulfilled, and the withdrawal succeeds.

Referenced code:
[DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L134](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L134)
[DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L146](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L146)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change line 134 to `delete pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user]` instead of setting the `pendingFlashDecision` to the default.

## [[H-05] Flash loan price manipulation in `purchasePyroFlan()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/231)
_Submitted by sirhashalot_

The comment on [line 54](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L54) of FlanBackstop.sol states "the opportunity for price manipulation through flash loans exists", and I agree that this is a serious risk. While the acceptableHighestPrice variable attempts to limit the maximum price change of the flan-stablecoin LP, a flashloan sandwich attack can still occur within this limit and make up for the limitation with larger volumes or multiple flashloan attacks. Flashloan price manipulation is the cause for many major hacks, including [bZx](https://bzx.network/blog/postmortem-ethdenver), [Harvest](https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/), and others.

#### Proof of Concept

[Line 83](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L83) of FlanBackstop.sol calculates the price of flan to stablecoin in the Uniswap pool based on the balances at a single point in time. Pool balances at a single point in time can be manipulated with flash loans, which can skew the numbers to the extreme. The single data point of LP balances is used to calculate [the growth variable in line 103](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L103), and the growth variable influences the quantity of pyroflan a user receives in [the premium calculation on line 108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L108).

```solidity
uint256 priceBefore = (balanceOfFlanBefore * getMagnitude(stablecoin)) / balanceOfStableBefore;
uint256 growth = ((priceBefore - tiltedPrice) * 100) / priceBefore;
uint256 premium = (flanToMint * (growth / 2)) / 100;
```

Problems can occur when the volumes that the `purchasePyroFlan()` function sends to the Uniswap pool are large compared to the pool's liquidity volume, or if the Uniswap pool price is temporarily tilted with a flashloan (or a whale). Because this function purposefully changes the exchange rate of the LP, by transferring tokens to the LP in a 2-to-1 ratio, a large volume could caught a large price impact in the LP. The code attempts to protect against this manipulation in [line 102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/FlanBackstop.sol#L102) with a require statement, but this can be worked around by reducing the volume per flashloan and repeating the attack multiple times. A user can manipulate the LP, especially when the LP is new with low liquidity, in order to achieve large amounts of flan and pyroflan.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a TWAP instead of the pool price at a single point in time to increase the cost of performing a flashloan sandwich attack. See [the Uniswap v2 price oracle solution ](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/core-concepts/oracles)documentation for more explanations on how Uniswap designed an approach to providing asset prices while reducing the change of manipulation.

**[gititGoro (Behodler) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/231#issuecomment-1030498476):**
 > This is a very well constructed report and if Flan was not intended to target a 1:1 with stablecoins, I'd accept it but since we know Flan shouldn't diverge far from 1:1, we don't run very large risks. Essentially, if the flan price crashes dramatically, backstop no longer works so the purpose of this contract is to just boost liquidity for Flan when Flan is operating under normal ish conditions. It's not intended to be black swan proof.

## [[H-06] Loss Of Flash Governance Tokens If They Are Not Withdrawn Before The Next Request](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/156)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

Users who have not called [withdrawGovernanceAsset()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L142)  after  they have locked their tokens from a previous proposal (i.e. [assertGovernanceApproved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60)), will lose their tokens if [assertGovernanceApproved()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60) is called again with the same `target` and `sender`.

The `sender` will lose `pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].amount` tokens and the tokens will become unaccounted for and locked in the contract. Since the new amount is not added to the previous amount, instead the previous amount is overwritten with the new amount.

The impact of this is worsened by another vulnerability, that is [assertGovernanceApproved()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60) is a `public` function and may be called by any arbitrary user so long as the `sender` field has called `approve()` for `FlashGovernanceArbiter` on the ERC20 token. This would allow an attacker to make these tokens inaccessible for any arbitrary `sender`.

#### Proof of Concept

In [assertGovernanceApproved()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60) as seen below, the line`pendingFlashDecision[target][sender] = flashGovernanceConfig` will overwrite the previous contents. Thereby, making any previous rewards unaccounted for and inaccessible to anyone.

Note that we must wait `pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime` between calls.
```solidity
function assertGovernanceApproved(
  address sender,
  address target,
  bool emergency
) public {
  if (
    IERC20(flashGovernanceConfig.asset).transferFrom(sender, address(this), flashGovernanceConfig.amount) &&
    pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime < block.timestamp
  ) {
    require(
      emergency || (block.timestamp - security.lastFlashGovernanceAct > security.epochSize),
      "Limbo: flash governance disabled for rest of epoch"
    );
    pendingFlashDecision[target][sender] = flashGovernanceConfig;
    pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp;

    security.lastFlashGovernanceAct = block.timestamp;
    emit flashDecision(sender, flashGovernanceConfig.asset, flashGovernanceConfig.amount, target);
  } else {
    revert("LIMBO: governance decision rejected.");
  }
}
```
#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider updating the initial if statement to ensure the `pendingFlashDecision` for that `target` and `sender` is empty, that is:
```solidity
function assertGovernanceApproved(
  address sender,
  address target,
  bool emergency
) public {
  if (
    IERC20(flashGovernanceConfig.asset).transferFrom(sender, address(this), flashGovernanceConfig.amount) &&
    pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime == 0
  ) {
...
```
Note we cannot simply add the new `amount` to the previous `amount` incase the underlying `asset` has been changed.

## [[H-07] LP pricing formula is vulnerable to flashloan manipulation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/304)
_Submitted by shw_

The LP pricing formula used in the `burnAsset` function of `LimboDAO` is vulnerable to flashloan manipulation. By swapping a large number of EYE into the underlying pool, an attacker can intentionally inflate the value of the LP tokens to get more `fate` than he is supposed to with a relatively low cost.

With the large portion of `fate` he gets, he has more voting power to influence the system's decisions, or even he can convert his `fate` to Flan tokens for a direct profit.

#### Proof of Concept

Below is an example of how the attack works:

1.  Suppose that there are 1000 EYE and 1000 LINK tokens in the UniswapV2 LINK-EYE pool. The pool's total supply is 1000, and the attacker has 100 LP tokens.
2.  If the attacker burns his LP tokens, he earns `1000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 2000` amount of `fate`.
3.  Instead, the attacker swaps in 1000 EYE and gets 500 LINK from the pool (according to `x * y = k`, ignoring fees for simplicity). Now the pool contains 2000 EYE and 500 LINK tokens.
4.  After the manipulation, he burns his LP tokens and gets `2000 * 100/1000 * 20 = 4000` amount of `fate`.
5.  Lastly, he swaps 500 LINK into the pool to get back his 1000 EYE.
6.  Compared to Step 2, the attacker earns a double amount of `fate` by only paying the swapping fees to the pool. The more EYE tokens he swaps into the pool, the more `fate` he can get. This attack is practically possible by leveraging flashloans or flashswaps from other pools containing EYE tokens.

The `setEYEBasedAssetStake` function has the same issue of using a manipulatable LP pricing formula. For more detailed explanations, please refer to the analysis of the [Cheese Bank attack](https://peckshield.medium.com/cheese-bank-incident-root-cause-analysis-d076bf87a1e7) and the [Warp Finance attack](https://peckshield.medium.com/warpfinance-incident-root-cause-analysis-581a4869ee00).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a fair pricing formula for the LP tokens, for example, the one proposed by [Alpha Finance](https://blog.alphafinance.io/fair-lp-token-pricing/).

# Medium Risk Findings (14)
## [[M-01] Incorrect `unlockTime` can DOS `withdrawGovernanceAsset`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/228)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

`unlockTime` is set incorrectly.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to contract at <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol>

2.  Observe the assertGovernanceApproved function

```solidity
function assertGovernanceApproved(
    address sender,
    address target,
    bool emergency
  ) public {
...
pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp;
...
}
```
3.  Assume assertGovernanceApproved is called with sender x and target y and pendingFlashDecision\[target]\[sender].unlockTime is 100 and block.timestamp is 10000 then

```solidity
pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp; // 10000+100=10100
```

4.  Again assertGovernanceApproved is called with same argument after timestamp 10100. This time unlockTime is set to very high value  (assume block.timestamp is 10500). This is incorrect

```solidity
pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime += block.timestamp; // 10100+10500=20600
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Unlock time should be calculated like below:
```solidity
constant public CONSTANT_UNLOCK_TIME = 1 days; // example
pendingFlashDecision[target][sender].unlockTime = CONSTANT_UNLOCK_TIME +  block.timestamp;
```

## [[M-02] Reentrancy on Flash Governance Proposal Withdrawal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/154)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

The function [withdrawGovernanceAsset()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L142) is vulnerable to reentrancy, which would allow the attacker to drain the balance of the `flashGoverananceConfig.asset`.

Note: this attack assumes the attacker may gain control of the execution flow in `asset.tranfer()` which is the case for many ERC20 tokens such as those that implement ERC777 but will depend on which asset is chosen in the configuration.

#### Proof of Concept

[withdrawGovernanceAsset()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L142) does not follow the check-effects-interactions pattern as seen from the following code snippet, where an external call is made before state modifications.

```solidity
function withdrawGovernanceAsset(address targetContract, address asset) public virtual {
  require(
    pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].asset == asset &&
      pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].amount > 0 &&
      pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].unlockTime < block.timestamp,
    "Limbo: Flashgovernance decision pending."
  );
  IERC20(pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].asset).transfer(
    msg.sender,
    pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].amount
  );
  delete pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender];
}
```

The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the following steps:

1.  `assertGovernanceApproved(userA, target, false)`
2.  wait for `unlockTime` seconds to pass
3.  `withdrawGovernanceAsset(target, asset)`  and gain control of the execution during `asset.transfer()`
4.  repeat step 3) until there balance of `FlashGovernanceArbiter` is less than `pendingFlashDecision[target][msg.sender].amount`

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are two possible mitigations, the first is to implement the check-effects-interactions patter. This involves doing as checks and state changes before making external calls. To implement this in the current context delete the `pendingFlashDecision` before making the external call as follows.
```solidity

## [[M-03] Burning a User's Tokens for a Flash Proposal will not Deduct Their Balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/157)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

The proposal to burn a user's tokens for a flash governance proposal does not result in the user losing any funds and may in fact unlock their funds sooner.

#### Proof of Concept

The function [burnFlashGovernanceAsset()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L124)  will simply overwrite the user's state with `pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user] = flashGovernanceConfig;` as seen below.
```solidity
function burnFlashGovernanceAsset(
  address targetContract,
  address user,
  address asset,
  uint256 amount
) public virtual onlySuccessfulProposal {
  if (pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user].assetBurnable) {
    Burnable(asset).burn(amount);
  }

  pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user] = flashGovernanceConfig;
}
```
Since `flashGovernanceConfig` is not modified in [BurnFlashStakeDeposit.execute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/Proposals/BurnFlashStakeDeposit.sol#L39) the user will have `amount` set to the current config amount which is likely what they originally transferred in {assertGovernanceApproved()]\(<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L60>).

Furthermore, `unlockTime` will be set to the config unlock time.  The config unlock time is the length of time in seconds that proposal should lock tokens for not the future timestamp. That is unlock time may be say `7 days` rather than `now + 7 days`. As a result the check in [withdrawGovernanceAsset()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/DAO/FlashGovernanceArbiter.sol#L146)  `pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][msg.sender].unlockTime < block.timestamp,` will always pass unless there is a significant misconfiguration.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider deleting the user's data (i.e. `delete pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user]`) rather than setting it to the config. This would ensure the user cannot withraw any funds afterwards.

Alternatively, only update `pendingFlashDecision[targetContract][user].amount` to subtract the amount sent as a function parameter and leave the remaining fields untouched.

## [[M-04] The system can get to a "stuck" state if a bad proposal (proposal that can't be executed) is accepted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/153)
_Submitted by CertoraInc_

#### LimboDAO.sol (`updateCurrentProposal()` modifier and `makeProposal()` function)

The LimboDAO contract has a variable that indicates the current proposal - every time there can be only one proposal. The only way a proposal can be done and a new proposal can be registered is to finish the previous proposal by either accepting it and executing it or by rejecting it. If a proposal that can't succeed, like for example an `UpdateMultipleSoulConfigProposal` proposal that has too much tokens and not enough gas, will stuck the system if it will be accepted. Thats because its time will pass - the users won't be able to vote anymore (because the `vote` function will revert), and the proposal can't be executed - the `execute` function will revert. So the proposal won't be able to be done and the system will be stuck because new proposal won't be able to be registered.

When trying to call the `executeCurrentProposal()` function that activates the `updateCurrentProposal()` modifier, the modifier will check the balance of fate, it will see that it's positive and will call `currentProposalState.proposal.orchestrateExecute()` to execute the proposal. the proposal will revert and cancel it all (leaving the proposal as the current proposal with `voting` state).

When trying to call `makeProposal()` function to make a new proposal it will revert because the current proposal is not equal to address(0).

To sum up, the system can get to a "stuck" state if a bad proposal (proposal that can't be executed) is accepted.

 > I'm so glad someone finally noticed this. So many issues logged skirted around this issue. A lot of issues were logged about adding too may token to the updateMultipleSoulProposal but the crux of the matter is that the proposal.execute() should be replaced with a call that returns a success boolean so that the DAO doesn't get stuck on broken proposals. Congratulations on spotting this.

## [[M-05] flan can't be transferred unless the flan contract has flan balance greater than the amount we want to transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/160)
_Submitted by CertoraInc_

#### Flan.sol (`safeTransfer()` function)

The flan contract must have balance (and must have more flan then we want to transfer) in order to allow flan transfers. If it doesn't have any balance, the safeTransfer, which is the only way to transfer flan, will call `_transfer()` function with `amount = 0`. It should check `address(msg.sender)`'s balance instead of `address(this)`'s balance.

```solidity
function safeTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
  uint256 flanBal = balanceOf(address(this)); // the problem is in this line
  uint256 flanToTransfer = _amount > flanBal ? flanBal : _amount;
  _transfer(_msgSender(), _to, flanToTransfer);
}
```

#### Proof of Concept

Taking into account the FOT is done almost everywhere important in the solution already. That's a known practice in the solution.

387:     uint256 fateCreated = fateState[_msgSender()].fateBalance;
388:     if (asset == domainConfig.eye) {
389:       fateCreated = amount * 10; //@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation
390:       ERC677(domainConfig.eye).burn(amount);//@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation
391:     } else {
392:       uint256 actualEyeBalance = IERC20(domainConfig.eye).balanceOf(asset);
393:       require(actualEyeBalance > 0, "LimboDAO: No EYE");
394:       uint256 totalSupply = IERC20(asset).totalSupply();
395:       uint256 eyePerUnit = (actualEyeBalance * ONE) / totalSupply;
396:       uint256 impliedEye = (eyePerUnit * amount) / ONE;//@audit-info wrong amount due to lack of FOT calculation
397:       fateCreated = impliedEye * 20;
398:     }
399:     fateState[_msgSender()].fateBalance += fateCreated; //@audit-info potentially wrong fateCreated as fateCreated can be equal to amount * 10;  
400:     emit assetBurnt(_msgSender(), asset, fateCreated);//@audit-info potentially wrong fateCreated emitted

```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-07] Calling `generateFLNQuote` twice in every block prevents any migration](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/102)
_Submitted by camden, also found by GeekyLumberjack, kirk-baird, and shw_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/71d8e0cfd9388f975d6a90dffba9b502b222bdfe/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L138>
In the Uniswap helper, `generateFLNQuote` is public, so any user can generate the latest quote. If you call this twice in any block, then the two latest flan quotes will have a `blockProduced` value of the current block's number.

These quotes are used in the `_ensurePriceStability` function. The last require statement here is key:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/71d8e0cfd9388f975d6a90dffba9b502b222bdfe/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L283-L285>

This function will revert if this statement is false:
```solidity
localFlanQuotes[0].blockProduced - localFlanQuotes[1].blockProduced > VARS.minQuoteWaitDuration
```

Since `VARS.minQuoteWaitDuration` is a `uint256`, it is at least 0
```solidity
localFlanQuotes[0].blockProduced - localFlanQuotes[1].blockProduced > 0
```

But, as we've shown above, we can create a transaction in every block that will make `localFlanQuotes[0].blockProduced - localFlanQuotes[1].blockProduced == 0`. In any block we can make any call to `_ensurePriceStability` revert.

`_ensurePriceStability` is called in the `ensurePriceStability` modifier:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/71d8e0cfd9388f975d6a90dffba9b502b222bdfe/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L70>

This modifier is used in `stabilizeFlan`:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/71d8e0cfd9388f975d6a90dffba9b502b222bdfe/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L162>

Lastly, `stabilizeFlan` is used in `migrate` in `Limbo.sol`
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/71d8e0cfd9388f975d6a90dffba9b502b222bdfe/contracts/Limbo.sol#L234>

Therefore, we can grief a migration in any block. In reality, the `minQuoteWaitDuration` would be set to a much higher value than 0, making this even easier to grief for people (you only need to call `generateFLNQuote` every `minQuoteWaitDuration - 1` blocks to be safe).

### Mitigation

Mitigation is to just use a time weighted oracle for uniswap.

But for now, I doubt that the incentive exists to perpetually grief migrations on Limbo. If someone does start to grief, we can add flash governance to the flan quote generation and then burn the EYE belonging to griefers but I was reluctant to call on the big guns right from the start.

## [[M-08] Tolerance is not enforced during a flash governance decision](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/306)
_Submitted by shw_

Most of the functions with a `governanceApproved` modifier call `flashGoverner.enforceTolerance` to ensure the provided parameters are restricted to some range of their original values. However, in the `governanceApproved` modifier, `flashGoverner.setEnforcement(true);` is called after the function body is executed, and thus the changed values are not restricted during the function execution.

An attacker can exploit this bug to change some critical parameters to arbitrary values by flash governance decisions. The effect will last until the community executes another proposal to correct the values. In the meanwhile, the attacker may make use of the corrupted values to launch an attack.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  An attacker executes a flash governance decision, for example, the `adjustSoul` function of `Limbo`, and sets the `fps` of a soul to an extremely large value.
2.  During the flash governance decision, some of his assets, for example, EYE, are locked in the `FlashGovernanceArbiter` contract.
3.  He calls `claimReward` to get his rewards on the corresponding soul (assume that he has staked some number of the token before). Because of the manipulated `fps`, he gets a large number of Flan tokens as the reward.
4.  Surely, he will lose his EYE tokens because of the malicious flash governance decision. However, as long as the attacker gets large enough Flan tokens, he is incentivized to launch such an attack.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Rewrite the `_governanceApproved` function and the `governanceApproved` modifier as follows:
```solidity
function _governanceApproved(bool emergency) internal {
  bool successfulProposal = LimboDAOLike(DAO).successfulProposal(msg.sender);
  if (successfulProposal) {
    flashGoverner.setEnforcement(false);
  } else if (configured) {
    flashGoverner.setEnforcement(true);
    flashGoverner.assertGovernanceApproved(msg.sender, address(this), emergency);
  }
}

modifier governanceApproved(bool emergency) {
  _governanceApproved(emergency);
  _;
}

_Submitted by Hawkeye_

If one of the variables that calculate adjustedRectangle is a zero value,it will impair the calculation of excessSCX which would equal to all of the scxMinted on line 219.Nothing will be deducted from scxMinted on line 229 since adjustedRectangle =0 putting all of the former at risk of being burnt(line 230).

Also, the check on line 224 would not pass for high value migrations since scxMinted would always be greater than the adjustedRectangle.No scx would be avaliable to be sent to the AMM helper nor would there be any LP minted.

Furthermore, since SCX is needed to ensure the proper functioning of the protocol,ie, to provide liquidity and influence the value of Flan, it would be imperative that the correct value of excessScx is accounted for.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Insert a require statement on line 222:
```solidity
require (AdjustedRectangle! =0, “ err”)
```

The only way it could be zero is if the inflation factor is zero which is a community set variable. However, there might be some funny community edge case where they want it set to zero. For instance, suppose the community feels in some distant future that flan is sufficiently liquid but that SCX is still a bit dilute.

#### Limbo.sol (`stake()` function)

If a user has a pending reward and he calls the `stake` function with `amount = 0`, he won't be able to get his reward (he won't get the reward, and the reward debt will cover the reward)

That's happening because the reward calculation is done only if the staked amount (given as a parameter) is greater than 0, and it updates the reward debt also if the amount is 0, so the reward debt will be updated without the user will be able to get his reward

_Submitted by camden, also found by robee_

The attack here allows the attacker to prevent migrations.

The attack here is recoverable because we can just call `buyFlanAndBurn` (f it worked as expected) with SCX as the input token to buy Flan with the extra SCX, then run the migration again.

#### Proof of Concept

The attack here is simple:

1.  Get some SCX
2.  Send it to the UniswapHelper contract
3.  Any migration called will revert

But, the caller of `stablizeFlan` assumes that the `rectangleOfFairness` parameter is going to be equal to the amount of SCX that was sent

The mitigation could be to do `>=` instead of `==` so sending tokens can't grief this.

Beyond this though, why do you need to pass in rectangleOfFairness if we're requiring it to be a function of the localSCXBalance anyways? <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/cedb81273f6daf2ee39ec765eef5ba74f21b2c6e/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L167>

## [[M-12] You can flip governance decisions without extending vote duration](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/106)
_Submitted by camden, also found by kirk-baird_

The impact here is that a user can, right at the end of the voting period, flip the decision without triggering the logic to extend the vote duration. The user doesn't even have to be very sophisticated: they can just send one vote in one transaction to go to 0, then in a subsequent transaction send enough to flip the vote.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/608cec2e297867e4d954a63fecd720e80c1d5ae8/contracts/DAO/LimboDAO.sol#L281>
You can send exactly enough fate to send the fate amount to 0, then send fate to change the vote. You'll never trigger this logic.

On the first call, to send the currentProposalState.fate to 0, `(fate + currentFate) * fate == 0`, so we won't extend the proposal state.

Then, on the second call, to actually change the vote, `fate * currentFate == 0` because `currentFate` is 0.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make sure that going to 0 is equivalent to a flip, but going away from 0 isn't a flip.

## [[M-13] Lack of access control in the `parameterize` function of proposal contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/296)
_Submitted by shw, also found by hyh and jayjonah8_

Most of the proposal contracts have a `parameterize` function for setting the proposal parameters, and these functions are protected only by the `notCurrent` modifier. When the proposal is proposed through a `lodgeProposal` transaction, an attacker can front-run it, modify the proposal parameters, and let the community vote it down. As a result, the person proposing loses his `fate` deposit.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  A benign user Alice wants to make a proposal, so she deploys one of the proposal contracts and sets the intended parameters. Her proposal is approved by the `ProposalFactory` and is ready to be proposed.
2.  Alice calls the `lodgeProposal` function of `ProposalFactory` to propose her proposal.
3.  An attacker Bob, who listens to the mempool, notices Alice's transaction and front-runs it. He calls the `parameterize` function to change the parameters to undesirable ones.
4.  Alice's proposal becomes the current proposal. However, the community rejects the proposal because of the changed parameters, causing Alice to lose her deposit.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only allow the creator of the proposal to modify the parameters.

## [[M-14] UniswapHelper.buyFlanAndBurn is a subject to sandwich attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler-findings/issues/230)
_Submitted by hyh_

Trades can happen at a manipulated price and end up receiving fewer Flan to be bought than current market price dictates.

For example, at the time a user decides to call `buyFlanAndBurn` Flan trades at 0.8 in the input token terms at the corresponding DEX pool. If the input token holdings are big enough to compensate for pool manipulation costs, the following can happen: Flan buy order will be seen by a malicious bot, that buys Flan, pushing it to 0.9 before UniswapHelper's order comes through, and selling it back right afterwards. This way, given a cumulative impact of the trades on Flan's market price, the input token will be overspent.

This yields direct loss for the system as input token market operations have lesser effect than expected at the expense of contract holdings.

#### Proof of Concept

`buyFlanAndBurn` doesn't control for swap results, executing swaps with exchange pool provided amounts, which can be manipulated:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-behodler/blob/main/contracts/UniswapHelper.sol#L231>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding the minimum accepted price as a function argument so a user can limit the effective slippage, and check that actually received amount is above this accepted minimum.

Also, in the future it will prudent to add a relative version of the parameter to control percentage based slippage with TWAP Oracle price as a benchmark.

 > You're not wrong but remember that the tokens that can be called here are specifically those that are not listed on Limbo and likely never will be BUT that also have Flan pools. It's unlikely that these pools will ever be significantly large as no incentives are provided for their maintenance.
