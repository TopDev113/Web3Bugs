# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Sturdy smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 13â€”May 15 2022.

## Wardens

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 8 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 6 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 43 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 40 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Sturdy contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy), and is composed of 5 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 366 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Hard-coded slippage may freeze user funds during market turbulence](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/133)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by berndartmueller, Picodes, IllIllI, sorrynotsorry, and WatchPug_

[GeneralVault.sol#L125](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol#L125)<br>
GeneralVault set a hardcoded slippage control of 99%. However, the underlying yield tokens price may go down.<br>
If Luna/UST things happen again, users' funds may get locked.<br>

[LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137)<br>
Moreover, the withdrawal of the lidoVault takes a swap from the curve pool. 1 stEth worth 0.98 ETH at the time of writing.<br>
The vault can not withdraw at the current market.<br>

Given that users' funds would be locked in the lidoVault, I consider this a high-risk issue.

### Proof of Concept

[1 stEth  = 0.98 Eth](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1524717773959700481/photo/1)

[LidoVault.sol#L130-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L130-L137)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are different ways to set the slippage.

The first one is to let users determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take.
The protocol front-end should set the recommended value for them.

```solidity
  function withdrawCollateral(
    address _asset,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _to,
    uint256 _minReceiveAmount
  ) external virtual {
      // ...
    require(withdrawAmount >= _minReceiveAmount, Errors.VT_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_MISMATCH);
  }
```

The second one is have a slippage control parameters that's set by the operator.

```solidity
    // Exchange stETH -> ETH via Curve
    uint256 receivedETHAmount = CurveswapAdapter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
      _addressesProvider,
      _addressesProvider.getAddress('STETH_ETH_POOL'),
      LIDO,
      ETH,
      yieldStETH,
      maxSlippage
    );
```

```solidity
    function setMaxSlippage(uint256 _slippage) external onlyOperator {
        maxSlippage = _slippage;

        //@audit This action usually emit an event.
        emit SetMaxSlippage(msg.sender, slippage);
    }
```

These are two common ways to deal with this issue. I prefer the first one.<br>
The market may corrupt really fast before the operator takes action.<br>
It's nothing fun watching the number go down while having no option.<br>

 > I realise there are 2 issues discussed here:
> 1) The high-risk severity relates to `GeneralVault`'s tight 1% slippage. Because it is inherited by vaults, it can cause withdrawals to fail and for user funds to be stuck.
> 2) However, in the context of the LIDO vault specifically, [#69's](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/69) first low-severity issue rightly points out that users can choose to withdraw their funds in stETH, then do conversion to ETH separately afterwards. Hence, funds won't actually be stuck. I would've therefore classified this a medium-severity issue. Nevertheless, it is expected that users will attempt to withdraw to ETH instead of stETH in times of market volatility.

## [[H-02] The check for value transfer success is made after the return statement in `_withdrawFromYieldPool` of `LidoVault`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/157)
*Submitted by pedroais, also found by 0x52, 0xliumin, cccz, CertoraInc, fatherOfBlocks, GimelSec, hake, hickuphh3, hyh, IllIllI, isamjay, mtz, oyc_109, p4st13r4, peritoflores, rotcivegaf, sorrynotsorry, StErMi, tabish, WatchPug, z3s, 0x4non, 0xf15ers, berndartmueller, dipp, Dravee, MaratCerby, saian, simon135, sseefried, and TerrierLover*

Users can lose their funds

### Proof of Concept

[LidoVault.sol#L142](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L142)<br>

The code checks transaction success after returning the transfer value and finishing execution. If the call fails the transaction won't revert since  require(sent, Errors.VT_COLLATERAL_WITHDRAW_INVALID); won't execute.

Users will have withdrawn without getting their funds back.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Return the function after the success check

# Medium Risk Findings (6)
## [[M-01] Possible lost msg.value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/62)
_Submitted by rotcivegaf, also found by AuditsAreUS, berndartmueller, cccz, MaratCerby, dipp, and StErMi_

[GeneralVault.sol#L75-L89](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol#L75-L89)<br>

Possible lost value in `depositCollateral` function call

### Proof of Concept

In call `depositCollateral` can will send value and the asset can be an ERC20(!= address(0)), if `LidoVault` and `ConvexCurveLPVault` contract receive this call the fouds will lost.<br>
Also in **LidoVault, L88**, if send as asset ETH(== address(0)) and send more value than `_amount`(msg.value > \_amount), the exedent will lost.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In **GeneralVault**, `depositCollateral` function:

*   Check if the `msg.value` is zero when the `_asset` is ERC20(!= address(0))
*   Check if the `msg.value` is equeal to `_amount` when the `_asset` ETH(== address(0))

```solidity
function depositCollateral(address _asset, uint256 _amount) external payable virtual {
  if (_asset != address(0)) { // asset = ERC20
    require(msg.value == 0, <AN ERROR FROM Errors LIBRARY>);
  } else { // asset = ETH
    require(msg.value == _amount, <AN ERROR FROM Errors LIBRARY>);
  }

  // Deposit asset to vault and receive stAsset
  // Ex: if user deposit 100ETH, this will deposit 100ETH to Lido and receive 100stETH TODO No Lido
  (address _stAsset, uint256 _stAssetAmount) = _depositToYieldPool(_asset, _amount);

  // Deposit stAsset to lendingPool, then user will get aToken of stAsset
  ILendingPool(_addressesProvider.getLendingPool()).deposit(
    _stAsset,
    _stAssetAmount,
    msg.sender,
    0
  );

  emit DepositCollateral(_asset, msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

Also can remove the `require(msg.value > 0, Errors.VT_COLLATERAL_DEPOSIT_REQUIRE_ETH);` in **LidoVault, L88**

## [[M-02] `UNISWAP_FEE` is hardcoded which will lead to significant losses compared to optimal routing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/48)
_Submitted by Picodes, also found by hickuphh3_

In [`YieldManager`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L48), `UNISWAP_FEE` is hardcoded, which reduce significantly the possibilities and will lead to non optimal routes. In particular, all swaps using ETH path will use the wrong pool as it will use the ETH / USDC 1% one due to this [line](https://github.com/sturdyfi/code4rena-may-2022/blob/d53f4f5f0b7b33a66e0081294be6117f6d6e17b4/contracts/protocol/libraries/swap/UniswapAdapter.sol#L50).

### Proof of Concept

For example for CRV / USDC, the optimal route is currently CRV -> ETH and ETH -> USDC, and the pool ETH / USDC with 1% fees is tiny compared to the ones with 0.3 or 0.1%. Therefore using the current implementation would create a significant loss of revenue.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Basic mitigation would be to hardcode in advance the best Uniswap paths in a mapping like itâ€™s done for Curve pools, then pass this path already computed to the swapping library. This would allow for complex route and save gas costs as you would avoid computing them in `swapExactTokensForTokens`.

Then, speaking from experience, as `distributeYield` is `onlyAdmin`, you may want to add the possibility to do the swaps through an efficient aggregator like 1Inch or Paraswap, it will be way more optimal.

## [[M-03] `processYield()` and `distributeYield()` may run out of gas and revert due to long list of extra rewards/yields](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/70)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by leastwood and StErMi_

Yields will not be able to be distributed to lenders because attempts to do so will revert.

### Proof of Concept

The `processYield()` function loops overall of the extra rewards and transfers them

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol   #1

105       uint256 extraRewardsLength = IConvexBaseRewardPool(baseRewardPool).extraRewardsLength();
106       for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraRewardsLength; i++) {
107         address _extraReward = IConvexBaseRewardPool(baseRewardPool).extraRewards(i);
108         address _rewardToken = IRewards(_extraReward).rewardToken();
109         _transferYield(_rewardToken);
110       }
```

[ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L105-L110](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L105-L110)<br>

There is no guarantee that the tokens involved will be efficient in their use of gas, and there are no upper bounds on the number of extra rewards:

```solidity
    function extraRewardsLength() external view returns (uint256) {
        return extraRewards.length;
    }


    function addExtraReward(address _reward) external returns(bool){
        require(msg.sender == rewardManager, "!authorized");
        require(_reward != address(0),"!reward setting");


        extraRewards.push(_reward);
        return true;
    }
```

[BaseRewardPool.sol#L105-L115](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L105-L115)<br>

Even if not every extra reward token has a balance, an attacker can sprinkle each one with dust, forcing a transfer by this function

`_getAssetYields()` has a similar issue:

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol   #X

129       AssetYield[] memory assetYields = _getAssetYields(exchangedAmount);
130       for (uint256 i = 0; i < assetYields.length; i++) {
131         if (assetYields[i].amount > 0) {
132           uint256 _amount = _convertToStableCoin(assetYields[i].asset, assetYields[i].amount);
133           // 3. deposit Yield to pool for suppliers
134           _depositYield(assetYields[i].asset, _amount);
135         }
136       }
```

[YieldManager.sol#L129-L136](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L129-L136)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Include an offset and length as is done in `YieldManager.distributeYield()`.

## [[M-04] ConvexCurveLPVault's `_transferYield` can become stuck with zero reward transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/79)
_Submitted by hyh_

Now there are no checks for the amounts to be transferred via \_transferYield and \_processTreasury. As reward token list is external and an arbitrary token can end up there, in the case when such token doesn't allow for zero amount transfers, the reward retrieval can become unavailable.

I.e. processYield() can be fully blocked for even an extended period, with some low probability, which cannot be controlled otherwise as pool reward token list is external.

Setting the severity to medium as reward gathering is a base functionality for the system and its availability is affected.

#### Proof of Concept

\_transferYield proceeds with sending the amounts to treasury and yieldManager without checking:

[ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L74-L82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L74-L82)<br>

```solidity
    // transfer to treasury
    if (_vaultFee > 0) {
      uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);
      yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);
    }

    // transfer to yieldManager
    address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount);
```

[ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L205-L209](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol#L205-L209)<br>

```solidity
  function _processTreasury(address _asset, uint256 _yieldAmount) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 treasuryAmount = _yieldAmount.percentMul(_vaultFee);
    IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_treasuryAddress, treasuryAmount);
    return treasuryAmount;
  }
```

The incentive token can be arbitrary. Some ERC20 do not allow zero amounts to be sent:

<https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers>

In a situation of such a token added to reward list and zero incentive amount earned the whole processYield call will revert, making reward gathering unavailable until either such token be removed from pool's reward token list or some non-zero reward amount be earned. Both are external processes and arenâ€™t controllable.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider running the transfers in \_transferYield only when yieldAmount is positive:

```solidity
+	if (yieldAmount > 0) {
	    // transfer to treasury
	    if (_vaultFee > 0) {
	      uint256 treasuryAmount = _processTreasury(_asset, yieldAmount);
	      yieldAmount = yieldAmount.sub(treasuryAmount);
	    }

	    // transfer to yieldManager
	    address yieldManager = _addressesProvider.getAddress('YIELD_MANAGER');
	    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_asset, yieldManager, yieldAmount);
+  }
```

## [[M-05] Withdrawing ETH collateral with max uint256 amount value reverts transaction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/85)
_Submitted by berndartmueller, also found by WatchPug_

Withdrawing ETH collateral via the `withdrawCollateral` function using `type(uint256).max` for the `_amount` parameter reverts the transaction due to `_asset` being the zero-address and `IERC20Detailed(_asset).decimals()` not working for native ETH.

#### Proof of Concept

[GeneralVault.sol#L121-L124](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol#L121-L124)

```solidity
if (_amount == type(uint256).max) {
    uint256 decimal = IERC20Detailed(_asset).decimals(); // @audit-info does not work for native ETH. Transaction reverts
    _amount = _amountToWithdraw.mul(this.pricePerShare()).div(10**decimal);
}
```

### Recommended mitigation steps

Check `_asset` and use hard coded decimal value (`18`) for native ETH.

## [[M-06] Yield can be unfairly divided because of MEV/Just-in-time stablecoin deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by mtz, also found by 0x52, hyh, jonah1005, leastwood, and sorrynotsorry_

[YieldManager.sol#L129-L134](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L129-L134)<br>
[YieldManager.sol#L160-L161](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L160-L161)<br>

An attacker can use MEV (via gas auction or Flashbots or control of miners) to cause an unfair division of yield. By providing a very large (relative to the size of all other stablecoin deposits combined) stablecoin deposit Just-in-Time before an admin's call to [distributeYield](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L118) the stablecoin deposited by the attacker will receive a very large amount of the yield and the attacker can immediately withdraw their deposit after yield is distributed. We assume this allows an attacker to get a lot of the yield reward even though they haven't provided any deposit that has been borrowed. However, the exact mechanism for how yield is distributed to lenders of a particular stablecoin is in LendingPool.sol, which is out of scope. However it is implied in [the documentation of this repo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L52) that it is based on the balance of that asset the lender has provided. We have confirmed that [in LendingPool.sol the yield is distributed based on the proportion of the asset provided](https://github.com/sturdyfi/code4rena-may-2022/blob/d53f4f5f0b7b33a66e0081294be6117f6d6e17b4/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L182). However, even ignoring this, MEV can still be used to unfairly hurt lenders of other stablecoins.

### Proof of Concept

1.  An attacker watches the mempool for calls to [distributeYield](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/main/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L118) by the admin.
2.  The attacker orders the block's transactions (most easily using a flashbots bundle) in the following order:<br>
    i. Attacker deposits stablecoins to lend (ideally the stablecoin will be the one with the least volume).<br>
    ii. admin's call to distributeYield happens.<br>
    iii. Attacker withdraws their deposit.<br>

The attacker has thus made the asset they deposited (and thus themselves) receive much of the yield even though they provide no value to Sturdy since none of their deposit is ever borrowed so the never do anything to earn yield for sturdy.
This attack can be done by a whale or by borrowing (even from sturdy) assets and converting them to a stablecoins accepted by sturdy before i. and returning them after iii. This will essentially be cost free for the attacker, none of their capital will ever be tied up by borrowers.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The simplest way to mitigate this is for the admin to use flashbots or some other means of submitting the distributeYield call that skips the mempool. This is only a partial mitigation since attackers can still withdraw right after yield is distributed and get lucky by depositing soon before the distribution thus still capture more yield than they should have.<br>
A better mitigation could use something like snapshotting who has deposited since the last yield distribution and only give these depositers yield based on the size of their deposits the next time yield is distributed.

 > We will use flashbots and vary when/how often yield is harvested to mitigate this.

## Summary

See [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy-findings/issues/69) for details.

## [L-01] Mistaken null values cause `distributeYield()` to revert
There are no null checks in the `registerAsset()` function, so admins can mistakenly pass 0x0 to that function, which will cause the for-loop to revert when that asset is reached. I've marked this as 'Low' rather than 'Medium' since the admin can work around it by using the `_offset` and `_count` input arguments to the function.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol   #1

118    function distributeYield(uint256 _offset, uint256 _count) external onlyAdmin {
119      // 1. convert from asset to exchange token via uniswap
120      for (uint256 i = 0; i < _count; i++) {
121        address asset = _assetsList[_offset + i];
122:       require(asset != address(0), Errors.UL_INVALID_INDEX);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L118-L122

## [L-02] Can't remove old assets
There is no way to remove old assets added by calls to `registerAsset()`. A disgruntled admin, before their access is revoked, can add a lot of assets and regularly sprinkle them with dust, so the new admins have to submit multiple calls to `distributeYield()` with different offsets and counts, to avoid the dust and possible reversion due to running out of gas

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol   #1

118    function distributeYield(uint256 _offset, uint256 _count) external onlyAdmin {
119      // 1. convert from asset to exchange token via uniswap
120      for (uint256 i = 0; i < _count; i++) {
121        address asset = _assetsList[_offset + i];
122        require(asset != address(0), Errors.UL_INVALID_INDEX);
123        uint256 _amount = IERC20Detailed(asset).balanceOf(address(this));
124        _convertAssetToExchangeToken(asset, _amount);
125:     }
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L118-L125

## [L-03] Missing checks for `approve()`'s return status
Some tokens, such as Tether (USDT) return false rather than reverting if the approval fails. Use OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()`, which reverts if there's a failure, instead

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol   #1

221:     IERC20(_asset).approve(_lendingPool, _amount);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L221

## [L-04] Move `ETH` constant to child contract
All of the functions in the `GeneralVault` require `0x0` when referring to Ether, not the constant here. Having it here will lead to mistakes down the line. It's only used by `CurveswapAdapter`, so it only needs to be there (it currently is also defined there).

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol   #1

47:    address constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol#L47

## [L-05] Unsafe casts and usage of `IERC20Detailed`
The `GeneralVault` is meant to be general, i.e. not specific to Lido or Curve, and therefore should not assume that the asset will always be `IERC20Detailed` (not all ERC20 contracts define `decimals()` since it's optional in the spec). Use [`safeDecimals()`](https://github.com/boringcrypto/BoringSolidity/blob/ccb743d4c3363ca37491b87c6c9b24b1f5fa25dc/contracts/libraries/BoringERC20.sol#L33-L55) instead

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol   #1

122:       uint256 decimal = IERC20Detailed(_asset).decimals();
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/GeneralVault.sol#L122

## [L-06] Unused `receive()` function will lock Ether in contract
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol   #1

24:     receive() external payable {}
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L24

## [L-07] `safeApprove()` is deprecated
[Deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bfff03c0d2a59bcd8e2ead1da9aed9edf0080d05/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L38-L45) in favor of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`. If only setting the initial allowance to the value that means infinite, `safeIncreaseAllowance()` can be used instead

*There are 3 instances of this issue:*

## [N-02] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

 > L5 should be addressed IMO. there is an inconsistency between addresses being used. The LIDO vault should be using the ETH constant instead of the null address for ETH, or vice versa. For someone who uses etherscan, he'll see the `ETH` constant define and assumes that he should be using that to specify ETH, then wonder why his tx will potentially revert in Metamask.

## [G-01] Add `require()` for asset address checks before doing the exchange

The code below should verify that the address is either `0x0` or the LIDO address, in order to prevent wasting gas by doing all of the operations between this point and the actual check done in `_depositToYieldPool()`

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol   #1

109    function _getWithdrawalAmount(address _asset, uint256 _amount)
110      internal
111      view
112      override
113      returns (address, uint256)
114    {
115      // In this vault, return same amount of asset.
116      return (_addressesProvider.getAddress('LIDO'), _amount);
117:   }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/LidoVault.sol#L109-L117>

## [G-02] Add an `unregisterAsset()` function

By unregistering and setting a mapping field to `0`, you'll be getting a Gsreset gas refund (2900 gas). If most `registerAsset()` calls are paired with `unregisterAsset()` calls, transactions will be cheaper

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol   #1

73     function registerAsset(address _asset) external onlyAdmin {
74       _assetsList[_assetsCount] = _asset;
75       _assetsCount = _assetsCount + 1;
76:    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/YieldManager.sol#L73-L76>

## [G-03] Multiple `address` mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address` to a `struct`, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/CollateralAdapter.sol   #1

27      mapping(address => address) internal _assetToVaults;
28      // External collateral asset -> internal collateral asset
29:     mapping(address => address) internal _collateralAssets;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-sturdy/blob/78f51a7a74ebe8adfd055bdbaedfddc05632566f/smart-contracts/CollateralAdapter.sol#L27-L29>

## [G-04] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching will replace each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read.<br>
Less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local storage variables of mappings within state variable mappings or mappings within state variable structs, having local storage variables of structs within mappings, having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

*There are 7 instances of this issue:*

## [G-05] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas

Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

*There are 6 instances of this issue:*

```solidity
File: smart-contracts/ConvexCurveLPVault.sol

205:    function _processTreasury(address _asset, uint256 _yieldAmount) internal returns (uint256) {

## [G-06] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop

The overheads outlined below are *PER LOOP*, excluding the first loop

*   storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (100 gas)
*   memory arrays use `MLOAD` (3 gas)
*   calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (3 gas)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (3 gas), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

## [G-08] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.0 to get overflow protection without `SafeMath`<br>
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get compiler automatic inlining<br>
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads<br>
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings<br>
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value<br>

## [G-13] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the value can be read from the verified contract source code. Savings are due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

## [G-14] Duplicated `require()`/`revert()` checks should be refactored to a modifier or function

Saves deployment costs

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*

## [G-15] Empty blocks should be removed or emit something

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be `abstract` and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (`if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...}` => `if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}`)

## [G-16] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are<br>
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

## [G-17] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public` and can save gas by doing so.
