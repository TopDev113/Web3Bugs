# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the OpenLeverage smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 27â€”February 2 2022.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 21 unique vulnerabilities and 83 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 5 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 15 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 22 non-critical recommendations and 40 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 OpenLeverage contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage), and is composed of 33 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 4251 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] OpenLevV1Lib's and LPool's `doTransferOut` functions call native `payable.transfer`, which can be unusable for smart contract calls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/75)
_Submitted by hyh_

When OpenLev operations use a wrapped native token, the whole user withdraw is being handled with a `payable.transfer()` call.

This is unsafe as `transfer` has hard coded gas budget and can fail when the user is a smart contract. This way any programmatical usage of OpenLevV1 and LPool is at risk.

Whenever the user either fails to implement the payable fallback function or cumulative gas cost of the function sequence invoked on a native token transfer exceeds 2300 gas consumption limit the native tokens sent end up undelivered and the corresponding user funds return functionality will fail each time.

As OpenLevV1 `closeTrade` is affected this includes user's principal funds freeze scenario, so marking the issue as a high severity one.

#### Proof of Concept

OpenLevV1Lib and LPool have `doTransferOut` function that calls native token payable.transfer:

OpenLevV1Lib.doTransferOut

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1Lib.sol#L253>

LPool.doTransferOut

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/liquidity/LPool.sol#L297>

LPool.doTransferOut is used in LPool redeem and borrow, while OpenLevV1Lib.doTransferOut is used in OpenLevV1 trade manipulation logic:

closeTrade

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L204>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L215>

liquidate

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L263>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L295>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L304>

#### References

The issues with `transfer()` are outlined here:

<https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

OpenLevV1's `closeTrade` and `liquidate` as well as LPool's `redeem`, `redeemUnderlying`, `borrowBehalf`, `repayBorrowBehalf`, `repayBorrowEndByOpenLev` are all `nonReentrant`, so reentrancy isn't an issue and `transfer()` can be just replaced.

Using low-level `call.value(amount)` with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin `Address.sendValue` is advised:

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L60>

# Medium Risk Findings (5)
## [[M-01] `UniV2ClassDex.sol#uniClassSell()` Tokens with fee on transfer are not fully supported](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/208)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/501e8f5c7ebaf1242572712626a77a3d65bdd3ad/openleverage-contracts/contracts/dex/bsc/UniV2ClassDex.sol#L31-L56>

```solidity
function uniClassSell(DexInfo memory dexInfo,
    address buyToken,
    address sellToken,
    uint sellAmount,
    uint minBuyAmount,
    address payer,
    address payee
) internal returns (uint buyAmount){
    address pair = getUniClassPair(buyToken, sellToken, dexInfo.factory);
    IUniswapV2Pair(pair).sync();
    (uint256 token0Reserves, uint256 token1Reserves,) = IUniswapV2Pair(pair).getReserves();
    sellAmount = transferOut(IERC20(sellToken), payer, pair, sellAmount);
    uint balanceBefore = IERC20(buyToken).balanceOf(payee);
    dexInfo.fees = getPairFees(dexInfo, pair);
    if (buyToken < sellToken) {
        buyAmount = getAmountOut(sellAmount, token1Reserves, token0Reserves, dexInfo.fees);
        IUniswapV2Pair(pair).swap(buyAmount, 0, payee, "");
    } else {
        buyAmount = getAmountOut(sellAmount, token0Reserves, token1Reserves, dexInfo.fees);
        IUniswapV2Pair(pair).swap(0, buyAmount, payee, "");
    }

    require(buyAmount >= minBuyAmount, 'buy amount less than min');
    uint bought = IERC20(buyToken).balanceOf(payee).sub(balanceBefore);
    return bought;
}
```

While `uniClassBuy()` correctly checks the actually received amount by comparing the before and after the balance of the receiver, `uniClassSell()` trusted the result given by `getAmountOut()`. This makes `uniClassSell()` can result in an output amount fewer than `minBuyAmount`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/501e8f5c7ebaf1242572712626a77a3d65bdd3ad/openleverage-contracts/contracts/dex/bsc/UniV2ClassDex.sol#L101-L102>

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function uniClassSell(DexInfo memory dexInfo,
    address buyToken,
    address sellToken,
    uint sellAmount,
    uint minBuyAmount,
    address payer,
    address payee
) internal returns (uint bought){
    address pair = getUniClassPair(buyToken, sellToken, dexInfo.factory);
    IUniswapV2Pair(pair).sync();
    (uint256 token0Reserves, uint256 token1Reserves,) = IUniswapV2Pair(pair).getReserves();
    sellAmount = transferOut(IERC20(sellToken), payer, pair, sellAmount);
    uint balanceBefore = IERC20(buyToken).balanceOf(payee);
    dexInfo.fees = getPairFees(dexInfo, pair);
    if (buyToken < sellToken) {
        buyAmount = getAmountOut(sellAmount, token1Reserves, token0Reserves, dexInfo.fees);
        IUniswapV2Pair(pair).swap(buyAmount, 0, payee, "");
    } else {
        buyAmount = getAmountOut(sellAmount, token0Reserves, token1Reserves, dexInfo.fees);
        IUniswapV2Pair(pair).swap(0, buyAmount, payee, "");
    }
    uint bought = IERC20(buyToken).balanceOf(payee).sub(balanceBefore);
    require(bought >= minBuyAmount, 'buy amount less than min');
}
```

## [[M-02] Missing payable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by robee_

The following functions are not payable but uses msg.value - therefore the function must be payable.
This can lead to undesired behavior.

        LPool.sol, addReserves should be payable since using msg.value

## [[M-03] Eth sent to Timelock will be locked in current implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/80)
_Submitted by defsec_

Eth sent to Timelock will be locked in current implementation. I came across this problem while playing around with the governance contract.

#### Proof of Concept

*   Setup the governance contracts (GovernanceAlpha, Timelock)
*   Send eth to timelock contract
*   Setup a proposal to send 0.1 eth out. Code snippet in ether.js below. proxy refers to GovernorAlpha.

```js
await proxy.propose(
    [signers[3].address],
    [ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")],
    [""],
    [ethers.BigNumber.from(0)],
    "Send funds to 3rd signer"
);
```
*   Vote and have the proposal succeed.
*   Execute the proposal, the proposal number here is arbitrary.

```js
await proxy.execute(2);  // this fails
    await proxy.execute(2, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")})  // this would work
    0.1 eth will be sent out, but it is sent from the msg.sender not from the timelock contract.
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the following code.
```solidity

function execute(uint proposalId) external {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Queued, "GovernorAlpha::execute: proposal can only be executed if it is queued");
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    proposal.executed = true;
    for (uint i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
        timelock.executeTransaction(proposal.targets[i], proposal.values[i], proposal.signatures[i], proposal.calldatas[i], proposal.eta);
    }
    emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
}
```

## [[M-04] OpenLevV1.closeTrade with V3 DEX doesn't correctly accounts fee on transfer tokens for repayments](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/104)
_Submitted by hyh_

The amount that OpenLevV1 will receive can be less than V3 DEX indicated as a swap result, while it is used as given for position debt repayment accounting.

This way actual funds received can be less than accounted, leaving to system funds deficit, which can be exploited by a malicious user, draining contract funds with multiple open/close with a taxed token.

In the `trade.depositToken != longToken` case when `flashSell` is used this can imply inability to send remainder funds to a user and the failure of the whole closeTrade function, the end result is a freezing of user's funds within the system.

#### Proof of Concept

`trade.depositToken != longToken` case, can be wrong repayment accounting, which will lead to a deficit if the received funds are less than DEX returned `closeTradeVars.receiveAmount`.

As a side effect, `doTransferOut` is done without balance check, so the whole position close can revert, leading to inability to close the position and freeze of user's funds this way:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1.sol#L197-204>

I.e. if there is enough funds in the system they will be drained, if there is not enough funds, user's position close will fail.

V3 sell function doesn't check for balance change, using DEX returned amount as is:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/dex/eth/UniV3Dex.sol#L61-70>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If fee on tranfer tokens are fully in scope, do control all the accounting and amounts to be returned to a user via balance before/after calculations for DEX V3 logic as well.

**[ColaM12 (OpenLeverage) confirmed and resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/104)**

 > Awesome find. I was able to confirm that `UniV3Dex.uniV3Sell()` does not properly handle fee-on-transfer tokens by treating the amount received as the difference between before balance and after balance.

## [[M-05] anti-flashloan mechanism may lead to protocol default](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/233)
_Submitted by gzeon_

There is a price check to avoid flash loan attacks which significantly moved the price. If current price is 5% lower than the stored twap price, the liquidation will fail. This design can be dangerous as it is to openleverage's benefit to close under-collateralized position ASAP when there is a huge market drawdown. When the market keep trading downward, it is possible that the spot price keep trading 5% lower than the twap, which prevent any liquidation from happening and causing the protocol to be under-collateralized.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/501e8f5c7ebaf1242572712626a77a3d65bdd3ad/openleverage-contracts/contracts/OpenLevV1Lib.sol#L191>

```solidity
// Avoid flash loan
if (prices.price < prices.cAvgPrice) {
    uint differencePriceRatio = prices.cAvgPrice.mul(100).div(prices.price);
    require(differencePriceRatio - 100 < maxLiquidationPriceDiffientRatio, 'MPT');
}
``` 

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of revert with `maxLiquidationPriceDiffientRatio`, use the twap price to determine if the position is healthy.
