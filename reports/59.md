# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Malt Finance contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 25â€”December 1 2021.

## Wardens

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 78 unique vulnerabilities and 178 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 5 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 30 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 43 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 25 non-critical recommendations and 75 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Malt Finance contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt), and is composed of 24 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 4,452 source lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (5)
## [[H-01] Timelock can be bypassed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/263)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0x0x0x and gzeon_

The purpose of a Timelock contract is to put a limit on the privileges of the `governor`, by forcing a two step process with a preset delay time.

However, we found that the current implementation actually won't serve that purpose as it allows the `governor` to execute any transactions without any constraints.

To do that, the current governor can call `Timelock#setGovernor(address _governor)` and set a new `governor` effective immediately.

And the new `governor` can then call `Timelock#setDelay()` and change the delay to `0`, also effective immediately.

The new `governor` can now use all the privileges without a delay, including granting minter role to any address and mint unlimited amount of MALT.

In conclusion, a Timelock contract is supposed to guard the protocol from lost private key or malicious actions. The current implementation won't fulfill that mission.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Timelock.sol#L98-L105>

```solidity
  function setGovernor(address _governor)
    public
    onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")
  {
    _swapRole(_governor, governor, GOVERNOR_ROLE);
    governor = _governor;
    emit NewGovernor(_governor);
  }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Timelock.sol#L66-L77>

```solidity
  function setDelay(uint256 _delay)
    public
    onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")
  {
    require(
      _delay >= 0 && _delay < gracePeriod,
      "Timelock::setDelay: Delay must not be greater equal to zero and less than gracePeriod"
    );
    delay = _delay;

    emit NewDelay(delay);
  }
```

#### Recommendation

Consider making `setGovernor` and `setDelay` only callable from the Timelock contract itself.

Specificaly, changing from `onlyRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, "Must have timelock role")` to `require(msg.sender == address(this), "...")`.

Also, consider changing `_adminSetup(_admin)` in `Timelock#initialize()` to `_adminSetup(address(this))`, so that all roles are managed by the timelock itself as well.

## [[H-02] Unable to remove liquidity in Recovery Mode](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/323)
_Submitted by gzeon_

According to <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt#high-level-overview-of-the-malt-protocol>

> When the Malt price TWAP drops below a specified threshold (eg 2% below peg) then the protocol will revert any transaction that tries to remove Malt from the AMM pool (ie buying Malt or removing liquidity). Users wanting to remove liquidity can still do so via the UniswapHandler contract that is whitelisted in recovery mode.

However, in <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L236>
liquidity removed is directly sent to msg.sender, which would revert if it is not whitelisted

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Liquidity should be removed to UniswapHandler contract, then the proceed is sent to msg.sender

## [[H-03] getAuctionCore function returns wrong values out of order](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/63)
_Submitted by jayjonah8_



#### Impact

In the `AuctionEscapeHatch.sol` file both `earlyExitReturn()` and `\_calculateMaltRequiredForExit` call the `getAuctionCore()` function which has 10 possible return values most of which are not used.  It gets the wrong value back for the "active"  variable since it's the 10th argument but both functions have it as the 9th return value where "preAuctionReserveRatio" should be because of one missing comma.  This is serious because these both are functions which deal with allowing a user to exit their arbitrage token position early.  This can result in a loss of user funds.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L527>

#### Tools Used

Manual code review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `AuctionEscapeHatch.sol` change the following in `\_calculateMaltRequiredForExit()` and earlyExitReturn() functions:

From:

(,,,,,
uint256 pegPrice,
,
uint256 auctionEndTime,
bool active
) = auction.getAuctionCore(\_auctionId);

To:

(,,,,,
uint256 pegPrice,
,
uint256 auctionEndTime,
,
bool active
) = auction.getAuctionCore(\_auctionId);

## [[H-04] `AuctionBurnReserveSkew.getPegDeltaFrequency()` Wrong implementation can result in an improper amount of excess Liquidity Extension balance to be used at the end of an auction ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/294)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/AuctionBurnReserveSkew.sol#L116-L132>

```solidity
  function getPegDeltaFrequency() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 initialIndex = 0;
    uint256 index;

    if (count > auctionAverageLookback) {
      initialIndex = count - auctionAverageLookback;
    }

    uint256 total = 0;

    for (uint256 i = initialIndex; i < count; ++i) {
      index = _getIndexOfObservation(i);
      total = total + pegObservations[index];
    }

    return total * 10000 / auctionAverageLookback;
  }
```

When `count < auctionAverageLookback`, at L131, it should be `return total * 10000 / count;`. The current implementation will return a smaller value than expected.

The result of `getPegDeltaFrequency()` will be used for calculating `realBurnBudget` for auctions. With the result of `getPegDeltaFrequency()` being inaccurate, can result in an improper amount of excess Liquidity Extension balance to be used at the end of an auction.

## [[H-05] AuctionEschapeHatch.sol#exitEarly updates state of the auction wrongly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/268)
_Submitted by 0x0x0x_

`AuctionEschapeHatch.sol#exitEarly` takes as input `amount` to represent how much of the

When the user exits an auction with profit, to apply the profit penalty less `maltQuantity` is liquidated compared to how much malt token the liquidated amount corresponds to. The problem is `auction.amendAccountParticipation()` simply subtracts the malt quantity with penalty and full `amount` from users auction stats. This causes a major problem, since in `_calculateMaltRequiredForExit` those values are used for calculation by calculating maltQuantity as follow:

`uint256 maltQuantity = userMaltPurchased.mul(amount).div(userCommitment);`

The ratio of `userMaltPurchased / userCommitment` gets higher after each profit taking (since penalty is applied to substracted `maltQuantity` from `userMaltPurchased`), by doing so a user can earn more than it should. Since after each profit taking users commitment corresponds to proportionally more malt, the user can even reduce profit penalties by dividing `exitEarly` calls in several calls.

In other words, the ratio of `userMaltPurchased / userCommitment` gets higher after each profit taking and user can claim more malt with less commitment. Furthermore after all `userMaltPurchased` is claimed the user can have `userCommitment` left over, which can be used to `claimArbitrage`, when possible.

#### Mitigation Step

Make sure which values are used for what and update values which doesn't create problems like this. Rethink about how to track values of an auction correctly.

`TIMELOCK_ROLE` Can Withdraw All FUND from the Contracts via `emergencyWithdrawGAS(), emergencyWithdraw(), partialWithdrawGAS(), partialWithdraw()`.

While I believe developer have good intention to use these functions. It often associate with Rug Pull by developer in the eyes of investors because Rug Pull is not uncommon in Defi. Investors lose all their hard earn money.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Pause the Contract and Disable All Functions when Bad Thing Happen rather than Withdraw All Fund to a random address.
2.  If Withdraw Fund can't avoid, a Multi Sig ETH Address should be hardcoded into the contract to ensure the fund move to a safe wallet.

## [[M-02] Frontrunning in UniswapHandler calls to UniswapV2Router](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/219)
_Submitted by thank_you, also found by 0x0x0x, cmichel, defsec, harleythedog, hyh, Koustre, leastwood, Meta0xNull, pauliax, pmerkleplant, tabish, WatchPug, and xYrYuYx_


UniswapHandler utilizes UniswapV2Router to swap, add liquidity, and remove liquidity with the UniswapV2Pair contract. In order to utilize these functionalities, UniswapHandler must call various UniswapV2Router methods.

*   addLiquidity
*   removeLiquidity
*   swapExactTokensForTokens (swaps for both DAI and Malt)

In all three methods, UniswapV2Router requires the callee to provide input arguments that define how much the amount out minimum UniswapHandler will allow for a trade. This argument is designed to prevent slippage and more importantly, sandwich attacks.

UniswapHandler correctly handles price slippage when calling [addLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L201). However, that is not the case for [removeLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L230) and swapExactTokensForTokens [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L148) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L173). For both methods, 0 is passed in as the amount out minimum allowed for a trade. This allows for anyone watching the mempool to sandwich attack UniswapHandler (or any contract that calls UniswapHandler) in such a way that allows the hacker to profit off of a guaranteed trade.

How does this work? Let's assume UniswapHandler makes a call to [UniswapV2Router#swapExactTokensForTokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L148) to trade DAI for Malt. Any hacker who watches the mempool and sees this transaction can immediately buy as much Malt as they want. This raises the price of Malt. Since UniswapHandler is willing to accept any amount out minimum (the number is set to [zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L150)), then the UniswapHandler will always trade DAI for Malt. This second transaction raises the price of Malt even further. Finally, the hacker trades their Malt for DAI, receiving a profit due to the artificially inflated price of Malt from the sandwich attack.

It's important to note that anyone has access to the UniswapV2Router contract. There are no known ACL controls on UniswapV2Router. This sandwich attack can impact even the `buyMalt` function.

The following functions when called are vulnerable to frontrunning attacks:

*   [UniswapHandler#buyMalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L131)
*   [UniswapHandler#sellMalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L160)
*   [UniswapHandler#removeLiquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L221)

And by extension the following contract functions since they also call the UniswapHandler function calls:

*   [Bonding#unbondAndBreak](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Bonding.sol#L114)
*   [LiquidityExtension#purchaseAndBurn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/LiquidityExtension.sol#L117)
*   [RewardReinvestor#splitReinvest](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/RewardReinvestor.sol#L78)
*   [StabilizerNode#stabilize](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/StabilizerNode.sol#L145)
*   [SwingTrader#buyMalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/SwingTrader.sol#L50)

#### Proof of Concept

Refer to the impact section for affected code and links to the appropriate LoC.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The UniswapV2Router and UniswapV2Pair contract should allow only the UniswapHandler contract to call either contract. In addition, price slippage checks should be implemented whenever removing liquidity or swapping tokens. This ensures that a frontrunning attack can't occur.

#### Anything Else We Should Know

I wish I had more time to work on this bug but unfortunately I have several current clients who require significant time from me. I'm happy to pursue this beyond the initial submission, in particular building a concrete PoC. I think the most important takeaway from this bug find is that anyone can purchase Malt at any time and anyone can manipulate the Malt reserve. This in turn impacts other functionalities that rely on the Malt reserve to make price/token calculations such as exiting an auction early or reinvesting rewards.

## [[M-03] AbstractRewardMine.sol#setRewardToken is dangerous](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/285)
_Submitted by 0x0x0x, also found by harleythedog and hyh_


In case the reward token is changed, `totalDeclaredReward` will be changed and likely equal to `0`.  Since `_userStakePadding` and `_globalStakePadding` are accumulated, changing the reward token will not reset those values. Thus, it will create problems.

#### Recommendation

I think it would be the best to remove this function.

If you want to keep it, then it must have an event and it should be used by a timelock contract. Furthermore, it has to be used carefully and the new token should be distributed such that padding variables still make sense.

## [[M-04] The Power Structure is Too Centralized And Protocol May Break If Anything Happen to Admin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/124)
_Submitted by Meta0xNull_


There are a lot of different roles in Malt Finance to handle different tasks. All these roles only can set by Admin. If anything happen to Admin and he/she no longer available, the protocol will start countdown to the end of life.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Some tasks don't really need a special role like StabilizerNode. Should allow any community members to run their own StabilizerNode without approval needed.
2.  Consider transfer Admin to Multisig or DAO.

## [[M-05] _notSameBlock() can be circumvented in bondToAccount() ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/195)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by leastwood and ScopeLift_


The function bondToAccount() of Bonding.sol has a check based on \_notSameBlock()
\_notSameBlock() makes sure the same msg.sender cannot do 2 actions within the same block.

However this can be circumvented in this case:
Suppose you call bondToAccount() via a (custom) smart contract, then the msg.sender will be the address of the smart contract.
For a pseudo code proof of concept see below.

I'm not sure what the deeper reason is for the \_notSameBlock() in bondToAccount().
But if it is important then circumventing this check it will pose a risk.

#### Proof of Concept

call function attack1.attack()

```JS
contract attack1 {
   function attack(address account, uint256 amount) {
         call attack2.forward(account, amount);
         call any other function of malt
  }
}

contract attack2 {
   function forward(address account, uint256 amount) {
       call bonding.bondToAccount(account, amount); // uses msg.sender of attack2
   }
}
```

```JS
function bondToAccount(address account, uint256 amount) public {
    if (msg.sender != offering) {
         _notSameBlock();
    }
    ...
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/Permissions.sol#L135-L141>

```JS
function _notSameBlock() internal {
    require( block.number > lastBlock[_msgSender()],"Can't carry out actions in the same block" );
    lastBlock[_msgSender()] = block.number;
  }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add access controls to the function bondToAccount()
An end-user could still call bond()

## [[M-06] AbstractRewardMine - Re-entrancy attack during withdrawal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/333)
_Submitted by ScopeLift_


The internal `_withdraw` method does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. A malicious token, or one that implemented transfer hooks, could re-enter the public calling function (such as `withdraw()`) before proper internal accounting was completed. Because the `earned` function looks up the `_userWithdrawn` mapping, which is not yet updated when the transfer occurs, it would be possible for a malicious contract to re-enter `_withdraw` repeatedly and drain the pool.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The internal accounting should be done before the transfer occurs:

```solidity
function _withdraw(address account, uint256 amountReward, address to) internal {
    _userWithdrawn[account] += amountReward;
    _globalWithdrawn += amountReward;f

   rewardToken.safeTransfer(to, amountReward);

    emit Withdraw(account, amountReward, to);
  }
```

## [[M-07] `MovingAverage.setSampleMemory()` may broke MovingAverage, making the value of `exchangeRate` in `StabilizerNode.stabilize()` being extremely wrong](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/313)
_Submitted by WatchPug_


<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/MovingAverage.sol#L424-L442>

```solidity
function setSampleMemory(uint256 _sampleMemory)
  external
  onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "Must have admin privs")
{
  require(_sampleMemory > 0, "Cannot have sample memroy of 0");

  if (_sampleMemory > sampleMemory) {
    for (uint i = sampleMemory; i < _sampleMemory; i++) {
      samples.push();
    }
    counter = counter % _sampleMemory;
  } else {
    activeSamples = _sampleMemory;

    // TODO handle when list is smaller Tue 21 Sep 2021 22:29:41 BST
  }

  sampleMemory = _sampleMemory;
}
```

In the current implementation, when `sampleMemory` is updated, the samples index will be malposition, making `getValueWithLookback()` get the wrong samples, so that returns the wrong value.

#### Proof of Concept

*   When initial sampleMemory is `10`
*   After `movingAverage.update(1e18)` being called for 120 times
*   The admin calls `movingAverage.setSampleMemory(118)` and set sampleMemory to `118`

The current `movingAverage.getValueWithLookback(sampleLength * 10)` returns `0.00000203312 e18`, while it's expeceted to be `1e18`

After `setSampleMemory()`, `getValueWithLookback()` may also return `0`or revert FullMath: FULLDIV_OVERFLOW at L134.

##### Recommendation

Consider removing `setSampleMemory` function.

## [[M-08] `_getFirstSample` returns wrong sample if count < sampleMemory](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/252)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `MovingAverage.sol` contract defines several variables that in the end make the `samples` array act as a ring buffer:

*   `sampleMemory`: The total length (buffer size) of the `samples` array. `samples` is initialized with `sampleMemory` zero observations.
*   `counter`: The pending sample index (modulo `sampleMemory`)

The `_getFirstSample` function computes the first sample as `(counter + 1) % sampleMemory` which returns the correct index only *if the ring buffer is full*, i.e., it wraps around. (in the `counter + 1 >= sampleMemory`).

If the `samples` array does not wrap around yet, the zero index should be returned instead.

#### Impact

Returning `counter + 1` if `counter + 1 < sampleMemory` returns a zero initialized `samples` observation index.
This then leads to a wrong computation of the TWAP.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an additional check for `if (counter + 1 < sampleMemory) return 0` in `_getFirstSample`.

## [[M-09] `UniswapHandler.maltMarketPrice` returns wrong decimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/255)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by gzeon_



The `UniswapHandler.maltMarketPrice` function returns a tuple of the `price` and the `decimals` of the price.
However, the returned `decimals` do not match the computed `price` for the `else if (rewardDecimals < maltDecimals)` branch:

```solidity
else if (rewardDecimals < maltDecimals) {
  uint256 diff = maltDecimals - rewardDecimals;
  price = (rewardReserves.mul(10**diff)).mul(10**rewardDecimals).div(maltReserves);
  decimals = maltDecimals;
}
```

Note that `rewardReserves` are in reward token decimals, `maltReserves` is a malt balance amount (18 decimals).
Then, the returned amount is in `rewardDecimals + diffDecimals + rewardDecimals - maltDecimals = maltDecimals + rewardDecimals - maltDecimals = rewardDecimals`.
However `decimals = maltDecimals` is wrongly returned.

#### Impact

Callers to this function will receive a price in unexpected decimals and might inflate or deflate the actual amount.
Luckily, the `AuctionEscapeHatch` decides to completely ignore the returned `decimals` and as all prices are effectively in `rewardDecimals`, even if stated in `maltDecimals`, it currently does not seem to lead to an issue.

#### Recommendation

Fix the function by returning `rewardDecimals` instead of `maltDecimals` in the `rewardDecimals < maltDecimals` branch.

## [[M-10] AuctionParticipant.sol: `setReplenishingIndex` mistake could freeze unclaimed tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/88)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

In AuctionParticipant.sol, the function `setReplenishingIndex` is an admin function that allows manually setting `replenishingIndex`. As I have shown in my two previous findings, I believe that this function could be called frequently. In my opinion (and Murphy's law would agree), this implies that eventually an admin will accidentally set `replenishingIndex` incorrectly with this function.

Right now, `setReplenishingIndex` does not allow the admin to set `replenishingIndex` to a value smaller than it currently is. So, if an admin were to accidentally set this value too high, then it would be impossible to set it back to a lower value (the higher the value set, the worse this issue). All of the unclaimed tokens on auctions at smaller indices would be locked forever.

#### Proof of Concept

See code for `setReplenishingIndex` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/AuctionParticipant.sol#L132>


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the require statement on line 136, so that an admin can set the index to a smaller value.

## [[M-11] No max for advanceIncentive](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/190)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by 0x1f8b_


The function setAdvanceIncentive of DAO.sol doesn't check for a maximum value of incentive.
If incentivewould be very large, then advanceIncentive would be very large and the function advance() would mint a large amount of malt.

The function setAdvanceIncentive() can only be called by an admin, but a mistake could be made.
Also if an admin would want to do a rug pull, this would be an ideal place to do it.

## [[M-12] Permissions - return values not checked when sending ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/329)
_Submitted by ScopeLift, also found by nathaniel_

On lines 85 and 101, ETH is transferred using a `.call` to an address provided as an input, but there is no verification that the call call succeeded. This can result in a call to `emergencyWithdrawGAS` or `partialWithdrawGAS` appearing successful but in reality it failed. This can happen when the provided `destination` address is a contract that cannot receive ETH, or if the `amount` provided is larger than the contract's balance

#### Proof of Concept

Enter the following in remix, deploy the `Receiver` contract, and send 1 ETH when deploying the `Permissions` contract. Call `emergencyWithdrawGAS` with the receiver address and you'll see it reverts. This would not be caught in the current code

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Receivier{}

contract Permissions {
  constructor() payable {}

  function emergencyWithdrawGAS(address payable destination) external {
    (bool ok, ) = destination.call{value: address(this).balance}('');
    require(ok, "call failed");
  }
}
```

#### Tools Used

Remix

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `emergencyWithdrawGAS`:

```diff
- destination.call{value: address(this).balance}('');
+ (bool ok, ) = destination.call{value: address(this).balance}('');
+ require(ok, "call failed");
```

## [[M-13] Reducing the epoch length results in leaking value from advancement incentives](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by TomFrench_


Unintended advancement incentives being paid out to third party

#### Proof of Concept

`DAO.sol` incentives outside parties to advance the epoch by minting 100 MALT tokens for calling the `advance` function. This is limited by checking that the start timestamp of the next epoch has passed.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L55-L63>

This start timestamp is calculated by multiplying the new epoch number by the length of an epoch and adding it to the genesis timestamp.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L65-L67>

This method makes no accommodation for the fact that previous epochs may have been set to be a different length to what they are currently.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/d3f6a57ba6694b47389b16d9d0a36a956c5e6a94/src/contracts/DAO.sol#L111-L114>

In the case where the epoch length is reduced, `DAO` will think that the epoch number can be incremented potentially many times. Provided the `advanceIncentive` is worth more than the gas necessary to advance the epoch will be rapidly advanced potentially many times paying out unnecessary incentives.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Rather than calculating from the genesis timestamp, store the last time that the epoch length was modified and calculate from there.

## [[M-14] Wrong permissions on `reassignGlobalAdmin`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/250)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Permissions.reassignGlobalAdmin` function is supposed to only be run with the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` role, see `onlyRole(TIMELOCK_ROLE, "Only timelock can assign roles")`.

However, the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` is not the admin of all the reassigned roles and the `revokeRole(role, oldAccount)` calls will fail as it requires the `ADMIN_ROLE`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The idea might have been that only the `TIMELOCK` should be able to call this function, and usually it is also an admin, but the function strictly does not work if the caller *only* has the `TIMELOCK` roll and will revert in this case.
Maybe governance decided to remove the admin role from the Timelock, which makes it impossible to call `reassignGlobalAdmin` anymore as both the timelock and admin are locked out.

Certain ERC20 tokens make modifications to their ERC20's `transfer` or `balanceOf` functions.
One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.

## [[M-16] theft of system profit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/56)
_Submitted by danb, also found by leastwood and WatchPug_

System profit comes from the stabilize function when the price of malt is above 1. Therefore it should not be allowed for anyone to take a part of the system profit when the price is above one. Right now, anyone can take a part of the investors' profits, even if they don't own any malt at all.

#### Proof of Concept

suppose that the price went up to 1.2 dai; the investors should get the reward for this rise. instead, anyone can take a part of the reward in the following steps:
The price of malt is now 1.2 dai.
Take a flash loan of a large amount of malt.
Sell the malt for dai.
Now the price went down to 1.1 dai because of the enormous swap.
Call stabilize in order to lower the price to 1 dai.
Buy malt to repay the flash loan at a lower cost with the bought dai.
Repay the flash loan, and take the profit.

It is a sandwich attack because they sold malt for a high price, then they called stabilize to lower the value, then repurchase it for a low price.

The user made a profit at the expense of the investors.

If a user already has malt, itâ€™s even easier:
just sell all malt at a high cost.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

in \_beforeTokenTransfer, if the price is above 1\$ and the receiver is the AMM pool, stabilize it.

## [[M-17] Auction collateralToken won't work if token is fee-on-transfer token ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/227)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

There are several ERC20 tokens that take a small fee on transfers/transferFroms (known as "fee-on-transfer" tokens). Most notably, USDT is an ERC20 token that has togglable transfer fees, but for now the fee is set to 0 (see the contract here: <https://etherscan.io/address/0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7#code>). For these tokens, it should not be assumed that if you transfer `x` tokens to an address, that the address actually receives `x` tokens. In the current test environment, DAI is the only `collateralToken` available, so there are no issues. However, it has been noted that more pools will be added in the future, so special care will need to be taken if fee-on-transfer tokens (like USDT) are planned to be used as `collateralTokens`.

For example, consider the function `purchaseArbitrageTokens` in Auction.sol. This function transfers `realCommitment` amount of `collateralToken` to the liquidityExtension, and then calls `purchaseAndBurn(realCommitment)` on the liquidityExtension. The very first line of `purchaseAndBurn(amount)` is `require(collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");`. In the case of fee-on-transfer tokens, this line will revert due to the small fee taken. This means that all calls to `purchaseArbitrageTokens` will fail, which would be very bad when the price goes below peg, since no one would be able to participate in this auction.

#### Proof of Concept

See `purchaseArbitrageTokens` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L177>

See `purchaseAndBurn` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/LiquidityExtension.sol#L117>


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add logic to transfers/transferFroms to calculate exactly how many tokens were actually sent to a specific address. In the example given with `purchaseArbitrageTokens`, instead of calling `purchaseAndBurn` with `realCommitment`, the contract should use the difference in the liquidityExtension balance after the transfer minus the liquidityExtension  balance before the transfer.

## [[M-18] AuctionParticipant.sol: `purchaseArbitrageTokens` should not push duplicate auctions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/87)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

In AuctionParticpant.sol, every time `purchaseArbitrageTokens` is called, the current auction is pushed to `auctionIds`. If this function were to be called on the same auction multiple times, then the same auction id would be pushed multiple times into this array, and the `claim` function would have issues with `replenishingIndex`.

Specifically, even if `replenishingIndex` was incremented once in `claim`, it is still possible that the auction at the next index will never reward any more tokens to the participant, so the contract would need manual intervention to set `replenishingIndex` (due to the if statement on lines 79-82 that does nothing if there is no claimable yield).

It is likely that `purchaseArbitrageTokens` would be called multiple times on the same auction. In fact, the commented out code for `handleDeficit` (in ImpliedCollateralService.sol) even suggests that the purchases might happen within the same transaction. So this issue will likely be an issue on most auctions and would require manual setting of `replenishingIndex`.

NOTE: This is a separate issue from the one I just submitted previously relating to `replenishingIndex`. The previous issue was related to an edge case where `replenishingIndex` might need to be incremented by one if there are never going to be more claims, while this issue is due to duplicate auction ids.

#### Proof of Concept

See code for `purchaseArbitrageTokens` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/AuctionParticipant.sol#L40>

Notice that `currentAuction` is always appended to `auctionIds`.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to the function to `purchaseArbitrageTokens` to ensure that duplicate ids are not added. For example, this can be achieved by changing auctionIds to a mapping instead of an array.

## [[M-20] Users Can Contribute To An Auction Without Directly Committing Collateral Tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/188)
_Submitted by leastwood_

`purchaseArbitrageTokens` enables users to commit collateral tokens and in return receive arbitrage tokens which are redeemable in the future for Malt tokens. Each auction specifies a commitment cap which when reached, prevents users from participating in the auction. However, `realCommitment` can be ignored by directly sending the `LiquidityExtension` contract collateral tokens and subsequently calling `purchaseArbitrageTokens`.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario:

*   An auction is currently active.
*   A user sends collateral tokens to the `LiquidityExtension` contract.
*   The same user calls `purchaseArbitrageTokens` with amount `0`.
*   The `purchaseAndBurn` call returns a positive `purchased` amount which is subsequently used in auction calculations.

As a result, a user could effectively influence the average malt price used throughout the `Auction` contract.

## [[M-21] `StabilizerNode` Will Mint An Incentive For Triggering An Auction Even If An Auction Exists Already](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/191)
_Submitted by leastwood_

`_startAuction` utilises the `SwingTrader` contract to purchase Malt. If `SwingTrader` has insufficient capital to return the price of Malt back to its target price, an auction is triggered with the remaining amount. However, no auction is triggered if the current auction exists, but `msg.sender` is still rewarded for their call to `stabilize`.

#### Proof of Concept

`_shouldAdjustSupply` initially checks if the current auction is active, however, it does not check if the current auction exists. There is a key distinction between the `auctionActive` and `auctionExists` functions which are not used consistently. Hence, an auction which is inactive but exists would satisfy the edge case and result in `triggerAuction` simply returning.

## [[M-23] `addLiquidity` Does Not Reset Approval If Not All Tokens Were Added To Liquidity Pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/228)
_Submitted by leastwood_

`addLiquidity` is called when users reinvest their tokens through bonding events. The `RewardReinvestor` first transfers Malt and rewards tokens before adding liquidity to the token pool. `addLiquidity` provides protections against slippage by a margin of 5%, and any dust token amounts are transferred back to the caller. In this instance, the caller is the `RewardReinvestor` contract which further distributes the dust token amounts to the protocol's treasury. However, the token approval for this outcome is not handled properly. Dust approval amounts can accrue over time, leading to large Uniswap approval amounts by the `UniswapHandler` contract.

_Submitted by leastwood_

`_distributeRewards` attempts to reward LP token holders when the price of Malt exceeds its price target. Malt Finance is able to being Malt back to its peg by selling Malt and distributing rewards tokens to LP token holders. An external call to `Auction` is made via the `allocateArbRewards` function. Prior to this call, the `StabilizerNode` approves the contract for a fixed amount of tokens, however, the `allocateArbRewards` function does not necessarily utilise this entire amount. Hence, dust token approval amounts may accrue from within the `StabilizerNode` contract.

## [[M-25] AMM pool can be drained using a flashloan and calling `stabilize`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/372)
_Submitted by stonesandtrees_

All of the `rewardToken` in a given AMM pool can be removed from the AMM pool and distributed as LP rewards.

#### Proof of Concept

In the `stabilize` method in the `StabilizerNode` the initial check to see if the Malt price needs to be stabilized it uses a short period TWAP:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/StabilizerNode.sol#L156>

However, if the price is above the threshold for stabilization then the trade size required to stabilize looks at the AMM pool directly which is vulnerable to flashloan manipulation.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L250-L275>

Attack:

1.  Wait for TWAP to rise above the stabilization threshold
2.  Flashloan remove all but a tiny amount of Malt from the pool.
3.  Call `stabilize`. This will pass the TWAP check and execute `_distributeSupply` which in turn ultimately calls `_calculateTradeSize` in the `UniswapHandler`. This calculation will determine that almost all of the `rewardToken` needs to be removed from the pool to return the price to peg.
4.  Malt will mint enough Malt to remove a lot of the `rewardToken` from the pool.
5.  The protocol will now distribute that received `rewardToken` as rewards. 0.3% of which goes directly to the attacker and the rest goes to LP rewards, swing trader and the treasury.

The amount of money that can be directly stolen by a malicious actor is small but it can cause a lot of pain for the protocol as the pool will be destroyed and confusion around rewards will be created.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a short TWAP to calculate the trade size instead of reading directly from the pool.

## [[M-26] Dutch auction can be manipulated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/375)
_Submitted by gzeon_

When malt is under-peg and the swing trader module do not have enough capital to buy back to peg, a Dutch auction is triggered to sell arb token. The price of the Dutch auction decrease linearly toward endprice until \_endAuction() is called. <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L589>

\_endAuction() is called in

1.  When auction.commitments >= auction.maxCommitments

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L212>

2.  On stabilize() -> checkAuctionFinalization() -> \_checkAuctionFinalization()

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/StabilizerNode.sol#L146>

3.  On stabilize() ->\_startAuction() -> triggerAuction() -> \_checkAuctionFinalization()

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/StabilizerNode.sol#L170>

It is possible manipulate the dutch auction by preventing \_endAuction() being called.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider someone call purchaseArbitrageTokens with auction.maxCommitments minus 1 wei, `_endAuction` won't be called because auction.commitments < auction.maxCommitments. Further purchase would revert because `purchaseAndBurn` (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Auction.sol#L184>) would likely revert since swapping 1 wei in most AMM will fail due to rounding error. Even if it does not revert, there is no incentive to waste gas to purchase 1 wei of token.

As such, the only way for the auction to finalize is to call stabilize().
However, this is not immediately possible because it require
`block.timestamp >= stabilizeWindowEnd` where
`stabilizeWindowEnd = block.timestamp + stabilizeBackoffPeriod`
stabilizeBackoffPeriod is initially set to 5 minutes in the contract

After 5 minute, stabilize() can be called by anyone. By using this exploit, an attacker can guarantee he can purchase at (startingPrice+endingPrice)/2 or lower, given the default 10 minute auctionLength and 5 minute stabilizeBackoffPeriod. (unless a privileged user call stabilize() which override the stability window)

Also note that stabilize() might not be called since there is no incentive.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Incentivize stabilize() or incentivize a permission-less call to \_endAuction()
2.  Lock-in auction price when user commit purchase

## [[M-27] Slippage checks when adding liquidity are too strict](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/257)
_Submitted by cmichel_

When adding liquidity through `UniswapHandler.addLiquidity`, the entire contract balances are used to add liquidity and the min amounts are set to 95% of these balances.
If the balances in this contract are unbalanced (the ratio is not similar to the current Uniswap pool reserve ratios) then this function will revert and no liquidity is added.

See `UniswapHandler.buyMalt`:

```solidity
(maltUsed, rewardUsed, liquidityCreated) = router.addLiquidity(
  address(malt),
  address(rewardToken),
  maltBalance, // @audit-info amountADesired
  rewardBalance,
  // @audit assumes that whatever is in this contract is already balanced. good assumption?
  maltBalance.mul(95).div(100), // @audit-info amountAMin
  rewardBalance.mul(95).div(100),
  msg.sender, // transfer LP tokens to sender
  now
);
```

#### Impact

If the contract has unbalanced balances, then the `router.addLiquidity` call will revert.
Note that an attacker could even send tokens to this contract to make them unbalanced and revert, resulting in a griefing attack.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It needs to be ensured that the balances in the contract are always balanced and match the current reserve ratio.
It might be better to avoid directly using the balances which can be manipulated by transferring tokens to the contract and accepting parameters instead of how many tokens to provide liquidity with from the caller side.

## [[M-28] Bonding.sol _unbondAndBreak does not account for edge case where no tokens are returned](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/234)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

In Bonding.sol, the internal function `_unbondAndBreak` transfers a user's stake tokens to the dexHandler and then calls `removeLiquidity` on the dexHandler. Within the Uniswap handler (which is the only handler so far) `removeLiquidity` takes special care in the edge case where `router.removeLiquidity` returns zero tokens. Specifically, the Uniswap handler has this code:

```solidity
if (amountMalt == 0 || amountReward == 0) {
  liquidityBalance = lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
  lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, liquidityBalance);
  return (amountMalt, amountReward);
}
```

If this edge case does indeed happen (i.e. if something is preventing the Uniswap router from removing liquidity at the moment), then the Uniswap handler will transfer the LP tokens back to Bonding.sol. However, Bonding.sol does not have any logic to recognize that this happened, so the LP tokens will become stuck in the contract and the user will never get any of their value back. This could be very bad if the user unbonds a lot of LP and they don't get any of it back.

#### Proof of Concept

See `_unbondAndBreak` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/Bonding.sol#L226>

Notice how the edge case where `amountMalt == 0 || amountReward == 0` is not considered in this function, but it is considered in the Uniswap handler's `removeLiquidity` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/c3a204a2c0f7c653c6c2dda9f4563fd1dc1cecf3/src/contracts/DexHandlers/UniswapHandler.sol#L240>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a similar edge case check to `_unbondAndBreak`. In the case where LP tokens are transferred back to Bonding.sol instead of malt/reward, these LP tokens should be forwarded back to the user since the value is rightfully theirs.

## [[M-29] User can bypass Recovery Mode via UniswapHandler to buy Malt ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/325)
_Submitted by gzeon_

One of the innovative feature of Malt is to block buying while under peg. The buy block can be bypassed by swapping to the whitelisted UniswapHandler, and then extract the token by abusing the add and remove liquidity function. This is considered a high severity issue because it undermine to protocol's ability to generate profit by the privileged role as designed and allow potential risk-free MEV.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  User swap dai into malt and send malt directly to uniswapHandler, this is possible becuase uniswapHandler is whitelisted

`swapExactTokensForTokens(amountDai, 0, [dai.address, malt.address], uniswapHandler.address, new Date().getTime() + 10000);`
2\) User send matching amount of dai to uniswapHandler
3\) User call addLiquidity() and get back LP token
4\) User call removeLiquidity() and get back both dai and malt

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

According to documentation in <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt#high-level-overview-of-the-malt-protocol>

> Users wanting to remove liquidity can still do so via the UniswapHandler contract that is whitelisted in recovery mode.

, this should be exploitable. Meanwhile the current implementation did not actually allow remove liquidity during recovery mode (refer to issue "Unable to remove liquidity in Recovery Mode")
This exploit can be mitigated by disabling addLiquidity() when the protocol is in recovery mode

## [[M-30] Malt Protocol Uses Stale Results From `MaltDataLab` Which Can Be Abused By Users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt-findings/issues/373)
_Submitted by leastwood_

`MaltDataLab` integrates several `MovingAverage` contracts to fetch sensitive data for the Malt protocol. Primary data used by the protocol consists of the real value for LP tokens, the average price for Malt and average reserve ratios. `trackMaltPrice`, `trackPoolReserves` and `trackPool` are called by a restricted role denoted as the `UPDATER_ROLE` and represented by an EOA account and not another contract. Hence, the EOA account must consistently update the aforementioned functions to ensure the most up-to-date values. However, miners can censor calls to `MaltDataLab` and effectively extract value from other areas of the protocol which use stale values.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider the following attack vector:

*   The price of Malt exceeds the lower bound threshold and hence `stabilize` can be called by any user.
*   The `_stabilityWindowOverride` function is satisfied, hence the function will execute.
*   The state variable, `exchangeRate`, queries `maltPriceAverage` which may use an outdated exchange rate.
*   `_startAuction` is executed which rewards `msg.sender` with 100 Malt as an incentive for triggering an auction.
*   As the price is not subsequently updated, a malicious attacker could collude with a miner to censor further pool updates and continue calling `stabilize` on every `fastAveragePeriod` interval to extract incentive payments.
*   If the payments exceed what the `UPDATER_ROLE` is willing to pay to call `trackMaltPrice`, a user is able to sustain this attack.

This threatens the overall stability of the protocol and should be properly handled to prevent such attacks. However, the fact that `MaltDataLab` uses a series of spot price data points to calculate the `MovingAverage` also creates an area of concern as well-funded actors could still manipulate the `MovingAverage` contract by sandwiching calls to `trackMaltPrice`, `trackPool` and `trackPoolReserves`.

`trackMaltPrice`, `trackPool`, and `trackPoolReserves` should be added to the following areas of the code where applicable.
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/Bonding.sol#L159>

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-malt/blob/main/src/contracts/ImpliedCollateralService.sol#L105>


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding calls to `trackMaltPrice`, `trackPoolReserves` and `trackPool` wherever the values are impacted by the protocol. This should ensure the protocol is tracking the most up-to-date values. Assuming the cumulative values are used in the `MovingAverage` contracts, then sensitive calls utilising `MaltDataLab` should be protected from flashloan attacks. However, currently this is not the case, rather `MovingAverage` consists of a series of spot price data points which can be manipulated by well-funded actors or via a flashloan. Therefore, there needs to be necessary changes made to `MaltDataLab` to use cumulative price updates as its moving average instead of spot price.
