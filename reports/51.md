# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Boot Finance contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 4—November 10 2021.

## Wardens

28 Wardens contributed reports to the Boot Finance contest:

# High Risk Findings (9)
## [[H-01] Contract BasicSale is missing an approve(address(vestLock), 2**256-1) call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/135)
_Submitted by Reigada, also found by WatchPug_

#### Impact

As we can see in the contracts `AirdropDistribution` and `InvestorDistribution`, they both have the following `approve() call: mainToken.approve(address(vestLock), 2\*\*256-1);`
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L499>
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L80>

This is necessary because both contracts transfer tokens to the vesting contract by calling its `vest()` function:
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L544>
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L569>
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L134>
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/InvestorDistribution.sol#L158>

The code of the `vest()` function in the Vesting contract performs a transfer from `msg.sender` to Vesting contract address -> `vestingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), \_amount);`
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/vesting/contracts/Vesting.sol#L95>

Same is done in the BasicSale contract:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/tge/contracts/PublicSale.sol#L225>

The problem is that this contract is missing the `approve()` call. For that reason, the contract is totally useless as the function `\_withdrawShare()` will always revert with the following message:
revert reason: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance. This means that all the `mainToken` sent to the contract would be stuck there forever. No way to retrieve them.

How this issue was not detected in the testing phase?
Very simple. The mock used by the team has an empty `vest()` function that performs no transfer call.
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/tge/contracts/helper/MockVesting.sol#L10>

#### Tools Used

Manual testing

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The following `approve()` call should be added in the constructor of the BasicSale contract:
`mainToken.approve(address(vestLock), 2\*\*256-1);`

## [[H-02] Can not update target price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/143)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by WatchPug_

#### Impact

The sanity checks in `rampTargetPrice` are broken
[SwapUtils.sol#L1571-L1581](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L1571-L1581)

```solidity
        if (futureTargetPricePrecise < initialTargetPricePrecise) {
            require(
                futureTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT) >= initialTargetPricePrecise,
                "futureTargetPrice_ is too small"
            );
        } else {
            require(
                futureTargetPricePrecise <= initialTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE).div(WEI_UNIT),
                "futureTargetPrice_ is too large"
            );
        }
```

If `futureTargetPricePrecise` is smaller than `initialTargetPricePrecise` 0.01 of `futureTargetPricePrecise` would never larger than `initialTargetPricePrecise`.

Admin would not be able to ramp the target price. As it's one of the most important features of the customswap, I consider this is a high-risk issue

#### Proof of Concept

Here's a web3.py script to demo that it's not possible to change the target price even by 1 wei.

```python
    p1, p2, _, _ =swap.functions.targetPriceStorage().call()
    future = w3.eth.getBlock(w3.eth.block_number)['timestamp'] + 200 * 24 * 3600

    # futureTargetPrice_ is too small
    swap.functions.rampTargetPrice(p1 -1, future).transact()
    # futureTargetPrice_ is too large
    swap.functions.rampTargetPrice(p1 + 1, future).transact()
```

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Would it be something like:

```solidity
        if (futureTargetPricePrecise < initialTargetPricePrecise) {
            require(
                futureTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE + WEI_UNIT).div(WEI_UNIT) >= initialTargetPricePrecise,
                "futureTargetPrice_ is too small"
            );
        } else {
            require(
                futureTargetPricePrecise <= initialTargetPricePrecise.mul(MAX_RELATIVE_PRICE_CHANGE + WEI_UNIT).div(WEI_UNIT),
                "futureTargetPrice_ is too large"
            );
        }
```

I believe the dev would spot this mistake if there's a more relaxed timeline.

## [[H-03] `SwapUtils.sol` Wrong implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/252)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

Based on the context, the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` used in price calculation should be calculated in realtime based on `initialTargetPrice`, `futureTargetPrice`, `futureTargetPriceTime` and current time, just like `getA()` and `getA2()`.

However, in the current implementation, `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` used in price calculation is the stored value, it will only be changed when the owner called `rampTargetPrice()` and `stopRampTargetPrice()`.

As a result, the `targetPrice` set by the owner will not be effective until another `targetPrice` is being set or `stopRampTargetPrice()` is called.

#### Recommendation

Consider adding `Swap.targetPrice` and changing the `_xp()` at L661 from:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/f102ee73eb320532c5a7c1e833f225c479577e39/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L661-L667>

```solidity
function _xp(Swap storage self, uint256[] memory balances)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256[] memory)
{
    return _xp(balances, self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers);
}
```

To:

```solidity
function _xp(Swap storage self, uint256[] memory balances)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256[] memory)
{
    uint256[2] memory tokenPrecisionMultipliers = self.tokenPrecisionMultipliers;
    tokenPrecisionMultipliers[0] = self.targetPrice.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_getTargetPricePrecise(self)).div(WEI_UNIT)
    return _xp(balances, tokenPrecisionMultipliers);
}
```

## [[H-04] Swaps are not split when trade crosses target price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/216)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by gzeon_

The protocol uses two amplifier values A1 and A2 for the swap, depending on the target price, see `SwapUtils.determineA`.
The swap curve is therefore a join of two different curves at the target price.
When doing a trade that crosses the target price, it should first perform the trade partially with A1 up to the target price, and then the rest of the trade order with A2.

However, the `SwapUtils.swap / _calculateSwap` function does not do this, it only uses the "new A", see `getYC` step 5.

```solidity
// 5. Check if we switched A's during the swap
if (aNew == a){     // We have used the correct A
    return y;
} else {    // We have switched A's, do it again with the new A
    return getY(self, tokenIndexFrom, tokenIndexTo, x, xp, aNew, d);
}
```

#### Impact

Trades that cross the target price and would lead to a new amplifier being used are not split up and use the new amplifier for the *entire trade*.
This can lead to a worse (better) average execution price than manually splitting the trade into two transactions, first up to but below the target price, and a second one with the rest of the trader order size, using both A1 and A2 values.

In the worst case, it could even be possible to make the entire trade with one amplifier and then sell the swap result again using the other amplifier making a profit.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Trades that lead to a change in amplifier value need to be split up into two trades using both amplifiers to correctly calculate the swap result.

## [[H-05] Claim airdrop repeatedly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/129)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by elprofesor, fr0zn, and pauliax_

#### Impact

Suppose someone claims the last part of his airdrop via `claimExact()` of `AirdropDistribution.sol`
Then `airdrop\[msg.sender].amount` will be set to 0.

Suppose you then call validate() again.
The check `airdrop\[msg.sender].amount == 0` will allow you to continue, because amount has just be set to 0.
In the next part of the function, `airdrop\[msg.sender]` is overwritten with fresh values and `airdrop\[msg.sender]`.claimed will be reset to 0.

Now you can claim your airdrop again (as long as there are tokens present in the contract)

Note: The function `claim()` prevents this from happening via `assert(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);`, which has its own problems, see other reported issues.

#### Proof of Concept

// <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L555-L563>

```solidity
function claimExact(uint256 \_value) external nonReentrant {
require(msg.sender != address(0));
require(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount != 0);`

    uint256 avail = _available_supply();
    uint256 claimable = avail * airdrop[msg.sender].fraction / 10**18; //
    if (airdrop[msg.sender].claimed != 0){
        claimable -= airdrop[msg.sender].claimed;
    }

    require(airdrop[msg.sender].amount >= claimable); // amount can be equal to claimable
    require(_value <= claimable);                       // _value can be equal to claimable
    airdrop[msg.sender].amount -= _value;      // amount will be set to 0 with the last claim
```
// <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L504-L517>
```solidity
function validate() external nonReentrant {
...
require(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount == 0, "Already validated.");
...
Airdrop memory newAirdrop = Airdrop(airdroppable, 0, airdroppable, 10\*\*18 \* airdroppable / airdrop_supply);
airdrop\[msg.sender] = newAirdrop;
validated\[msg.sender] = 1;   // this is set, but isn't checked on entry of this function
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following to `validate() :
require(validated\[msg.sender]== 0, "Already validated.");`

## [[H-06] Ideal balance is not calculated correctly when providing imbalanced liquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/150)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact

When a user provides imbalanced liquidity, the fee is calculated according to the ideal balance. In saddle finance, the optimal balance should be the same ratio as in the Pool.

Take, for example, if there's 10000 USD and 10000 DAI in the saddle's USD/DAI pool, the user should get the optimal lp if he provides lp with ratio = 1.

However, if the `customSwap` pool is created with a target price = 2. The user would get 2 times more lp if he deposits DAI.
[SwapUtils.sol#L1227-L1245](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L1227-L1245)
The current implementation does not calculates ideal balance correctly.

If the target price is set to be 10, the ideal balance deviates by 10.
The fee deviates a lot. I consider this is a high-risk issues.

#### Proof of Concept

We can observe the issue if we initiates two pools DAI/LINK pool and set the target price to be 4.

For the first pool, we deposit more DAI.

```python
    swap = deploy_contract('Swap' 
        [dai.address, link.address], [18, 18], 'lp', 'lp', 1, 85, 10**7, 0, 0, 4* 10**18)
    link.functions.approve(swap.address, deposit_amount).transact()
    dai.functions.approve(swap.address, deposit_amount).transact()
    previous_lp = lptoken.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
    swap.functions.addLiquidity([deposit_amount, deposit_amount // 10], 10, 10**18).transact()
    post_lp = lptoken.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
    print('get lp', post_lp - previous_lp)
```

For the second pool, one we deposit more DAI.

```python
    swap = deploy_contract('Swap' 
        [dai.address, link.address], [18, 18], 'lp', 'lp', 1, 85, 10**7, 0, 0, 4* 10**18)
    link.functions.approve(swap.address, deposit_amount).transact()
    dai.functions.approve(swap.address, deposit_amount).transact()
    previous_lp = lptoken.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
    swap.functions.addLiquidity([deposit_amount, deposit_amount // 10], 10, 10**18).transact()
    post_lp = lptoken.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
    print('get lp', post_lp - previous_lp)
```

We can get roughly 4x more lp in the first case

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The current implementation uses `self.balances`

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/SwapUtils.sol#L1231-L1236>

```js
for (uint256 i = 0; i < self.pooledTokens.length; i++) {
    uint256 idealBalance = v.d1.mul(self.balances[i]).div(v.d0);
    fees[i] = feePerToken
        .mul(idealBalance.difference(newBalances[i]))
        .div(FEE_DENOMINATOR);
    self.balances[i] = newBalances[i].sub(
        fees[i].mul(self.adminFee).div(FEE_DENOMINATOR)
    );
    newBalances[i] = newBalances[i].sub(fees[i]);
}
```

Replaces `self.balances` with `_xp(self, newBalances)` would be a simple fix.
I consider the team can take balance's weighted pool as a reference. [WeightedMath.sol#L149-L179](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/7ff72a23bae6ce0eb5b134953cc7d5b79a19d099/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedMath.sol#L149-L179)

## [[H-07] `customPrecisionMultipliers` would be rounded to zero and break the pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/183)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact

`CustomPrecisionMultipliers` are set in the constructor:

```solidity
customPrecisionMultipliers[0] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_targetPrice).div(10 ** 18);
```

`originalPrecisionMultipliers` equal to 1 if the token's decimal = 18. The targe price could only be an integer.

If the target price is bigger than 10\*\*18, the user can deposit and trade in the pool. Though, the functionality would be far from the spec.

If the target price is set to be smaller than 10\*\*18, the pool would be broken and all funds would be stuck.

I consider this is a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

We can also trigger the bug by setting a pool with target price = 0.5. (0.5 \* 10\*\*18)

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend providing extra 10\*\*18 in both multipliers.

```solidity
customPrecisionMultipliers[0] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(_targetPrice).mul(10**18).div(10 ** 18);
customPrecisionMultipliers[1] = targetPriceStorage.originalPrecisionMultipliers[1].mul(10**18);
```

The customswap only supports two tokens in a pool, there's should be enough space. Recommend the devs to go through the trade-off saddle finance has paid to support multiple tokens. The code could be more clean and efficient if the pools' not support multiple tokens.

## [[H-08] Unable to claim vesting due to unbounded timelock loop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/120)
_Submitted by nathaniel, also found by WatchPug, leastwood, and pauliax_

#### Impact

The timelocks for any *beneficiary* are unbounded, and can be vested by someone who is not the *beneficiary*. When the array becomes significantly big enough, the vestments will no longer be claimable for the *beneficiary*.

The `vest()` function in Vesting.sol does not check the *beneficiary*, hence anyone can vest for anyone else, pushing a new timelock to the `timelocks[_beneficiary]`.
The `_claimableAmount()` function (used by `claim()` function), then loops through the `timelocks[_beneficiary]` to determine the amount to be claimed.
A malicious actor can easy repeatedly call the `vest()` function with minute amounts to make the array large enough, such that when it comes to claiming, it will exceed the gas limit and revert, rendering the vestment for the beneficiary unclaimable.
The malicious actor could do this to each *beneficiary*, locking up all the vestments.

#### Proof of Concept

#### Tools Used

Manual code review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Create a minimum on the vestment amounts, such that it won't be feasible for a malicious actor to create a large amount of vestments.
*   Restrict the vestment contribution of a *beneficiary* where `require(beneficiary == msg.sender)`

#### Impact

When add investor, `addInvestor()` does not check how many tokens is available from `investors_supply`. The total tokens allocated for Investors could more than `investors_supply`.

Possible Attack Scenario:

# Medium Risk Findings (12)
## [[M-01] Unchecked transfers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by Reigada, also found by Ruhum, loop, cmichel, defsec, pauliax, WatchPug, and 0v3rf10w_

#### Impact

Multiple calls to `transferFrom` and transfer are frequently done without checking the results. For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of “false” is returned. It’s important to check this. If you don’t, in this concrete case, some airdrop eligible participants could be left without their tokens. It is also a best practice to check this.

#### Proof of Concept
```
AirdropDistributionMock.sol:132:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);
AirdropDistributionMock.sol:157:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);
AirdropDistribution.sol:542:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);
AirdropDistribution.sol:567:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);

InvestorDistribution.sol:132:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);
InvestorDistribution.sol:156:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable_to_send);
InvestorDistribution.sol:207:        mainToken.transfer(msg.sender, bal);

Vesting.sol:95:        vestingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), \_amount);

PublicSale.sol:224:            mainToken.transfer(\_member, v_value);
```
#### Tools Used

Manual testing

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check the result of `transferFrom` and transfer. Although if this is done, the contracts will not be compatible with non standard ERC20 tokens like USDT. For that reason, I would rather recommend making use of SafeERC20 library: `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`.

#### Impact

Unchecked low-level calls

#### Proof of Concept

Unchecked cases at 2 places :-
`BasicSale.receive()` (2021-11-bootfinance/tge/contracts/PublicSale.sol#148-156) ignores return value by `burnAddress.call{value: msg.value}()` (2021-11-bootfinance/tge/contracts/PublicSale.sol#154)

#### Tools Used

Manual

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls.

#### Impact

Suppose you are an investor and want to claim the last part of your claimable tokens (or your entire set of claimable tokens if you haven't claimed anything yet).
Then you call the function `claim()` of `InvestorDistribution.sol`, which has the following statement:
`require(investors\[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);`
This statement will prevent you from claiming your tokens because it will stop execution.

Note: with the function `claimExact()` it is possible to claim the last part.

## [[M-04] Get virtual price is not monotonically increasing ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/185)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact

There's a feature of `virtualPrice` that is monotonically increasing regardless of the market. This function is heavily used in multiple protocols. e.g.(curve metapool, mim, ...) This is not held in the current implementation of customSwap since `customPrecisionMultipliers` can be changed by changing the target price.

There are two issues here:
The meaning of `virtualPrice` would be vague.
This may damage the lp providers as the protocol that adopts it may be hacked.

I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

We can set up a mockSwap with extra `setPrecisionMultiplier` to check the issue.

```solidity
    function setPrecisionMultiplier(uint256 multipliers) external {
        swapStorage.tokenPrecisionMultipliers[0] = multipliers; 
    }
```

```python
    print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())
    swap.functions.setPrecisionMultiplier(2).transact()
    print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())

# output log:
#   1000000000000000000
#   1499889859738721606
```

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Dealing with the target price with multiplier precision seems clever as we can reuse most of the existing code. However, the precision multiplier should be an immutable parameter. Changing it after the pool is set up would create multiple issues. This function could be implemented in a safer way IMHO.

The quick fix would be to remove the `getVirtualPrice` function. I can't come up with a safe way if other protocol wants to use this function.

## [[M-05] Stop ramp target price would create huge arbitrage space.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/208)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

### Stop ramp target price would create huge arbitrage space.

#### Impact

`stopRampTargetPrice` would set the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` to `originalPrecisionMultipliers[0].mul(currentTargetPrice).div(WEI_UNIT);`
Once the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` is changed, the price in the AMM pool would change. Arbitrager can sandwich `stopRampTargetPrice` to gain profit.

Assume the decision is made in the DAO, an attacker can set up the bot once the proposal to `stopRampTargetPrice` has passed. I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

The `precisionMultiplier` is set here:
[Swap.sol#L661-L666](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/main/customswap/contracts/Swap.sol#L661-L666)

We can set up a mockSwap with extra `setPrecisionMultiplier` to check the issue.

```solidity
function setPrecisionMultiplier(uint256 multipliers) external {
    swapStorage.tokenPrecisionMultipliers[0] = multipliers; 
}
```

```python
print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())
swap.functions.setPrecisionMultiplier(2).transact()
print(swap.functions.getVirtualPrice().call())

# output log:
#     1000000000000000000
#     1499889859738721606
```

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Dealing with the target price with multiplier precision seems clever as we can reuse most of the existing code. However, the precision multiplier should be an immutable parameter. Changing it after the pool is setup would create multiple issues. This function could be implemented in a safer way IMHO.

A quick fix I would come up with is to ramp the `tokenPrecisionMultipliers` as the `aPrecise` is ramped. As the `tokenPrecision` is slowly increased/decreased, the arbitrage space would be slower and the profit would (probably) distribute evenly to lpers.

## [[M-09] NFT flashloans can bypass sale constraints](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/276)
_Submitted by pauliax_

#### Impact

Public sale has a constraint that for the first 4 weeks only NFT holders can access the sale:

```solidity
if (currentEra < firstPublicEra) {
    require(nft.balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0, "You need NFT to participate in the sale.");
}
```

However, this check can be easily bypassed with the help of flash loans. You can borrow the NFT, participate in the sale and then return this NFT in one transaction. It takes only 1 NFT that could be flashloaned again and again to give access to the sale for everyone (`burnEtherForMember`).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I am not sure what could be the most elegant solution to this problem. You may consider transferring and locking this NFT for at least 1 block but then the user will need to do an extra tx to retrieve it back. You may consider taking a snapshot of user balances so the same NFT can be used by one address only but then this NFT will lose its extra benefit of selling it during the pre-sale when it acts as a pre-sale token. You may consider checking that the caller is EOA but again there are ways to bypass that too.

## [[M-10] Can't claim last part of airdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/130)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact

Suppose you are eligible for the last part of your airdrop (or your entire airdrop if you haven't claimed anything yet).
Then you call the function claim() of AirdropDistribution.sol, which has the following statement:
`assert(airdrop\[msg.sender].amount - claimable != 0);`
This statement will prevent you from claiming your airdrop because it will stop execution.

Note: with the function `claimExact()` it is possible to claim the last part.

#### Proof of Concept

// <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/AirdropDistribution.sol#L522-L536>

```solidity

`require(validated\[msg.sender]== 0, "Already validated.");`

## [[M-11] Overwrite benRevocable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by pauliax, WatchPug, cmichel, hyh, and leastwood_

#### Impact

Anyone can call the function `vest()` of `Vesting.sol`, for example with a smail `\_amount` of tokens, for any `\_beneficiary`.

The function overwrites the value of `benRevocable\[\_beneficiary]`, effectively erasing any previous value.

So you can set any `\_beneficiary` to Revocable.
Although `revoke()` is only callable by the owner, this is circumventing the entire mechanism of `benRevocable`.

#### Proof of Concept

// <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/vesting/contracts/Vesting.sol#L73-L98>

```solidity
function vest(address \_beneficiary, uint256 \_amount, uint256 \_isRevocable) external payable whenNotPaused {
    ...
if(\_isRevocable == 0){
    benRevocable\[\_beneficiary] = \[false,false];  // just overwrites the value
}
else if(\_isRevocable == 1){
    benRevocable\[\_beneficiary] = \[true,false]; // just overwrites the value
}
```


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Whitelist the calling of `vest()`
Or check if values for `benRevocable` are already set.

## [[M-12] No Transfer Ownership Pattern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by defsec, also found by Ruhum, elprofesor, pauliax, Reigada, and mics_

#### Impact

The current ownership transfer process involves the current owner calling `Swap.transferOwnership()`. This function checks the new owner is not the zero address and proceeds to write the new owner's address into the owner's state variable. If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible the owner may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled account, breaking all functions with the `onlyOwner()` modifier.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to "<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-bootfinance/blob/7c457b2b5ba6b2c887dafdf7428fd577e405d652/customswap/contracts/Swap.sol#L30>"
2.  The contract has many `onlyOwner` function.
3.  The contract is inherited from the Ownable which includes `transferOwnership`.

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement zero address check and consider implementing a two step process where the owner nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.
