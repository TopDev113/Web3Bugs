# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Yield-Convex contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 28â€”January 30 2022.

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Malicious Users Can Duplicate Protocol Earned Yield By Transferring `wCVX` Tokens To Another Account](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by kenzo_

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user's behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract's `batch()` function which:

*   Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
*   Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
*   Wraps/stakes these tokens.
*   Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

During `wrap()` and `unwrap()` actions, `_checkpoint()` is used to update the rewards for the `from_` and `to_` accounts. However, the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract implements a `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function which has been removed from Yield Protocol's custom implementation.

As a result, it is possible to transfer `wCVX` tokens to another account after an initial checkpoint has been made. By manually calling `user_checkpoint()` on the new account, this user is able to update its deposited balance of the new account while the sender's balance is not updated. This can be repeated to effectively replicate a user's deposited balance over any number of accounts. To claim yield generated by the protocol, the user must only make sure that the account calling `getReward()` holds the tokens for the duration of the call.

#### Proof of Concept

The exploit can be outlined through the following steps:

*   Alice receives 100 `wCVX` tokens from the protocol after wrapping their convex tokens.
*   At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
*   Alice transfers her tokens to her friend Bob who then manually calls `user_checkpoint()` to update his balance.
*   Now from the perspective of the protocol, both Alice and Bob have 100 `wCVX` tokens as calculated by the `_getDepositedBalance()` function.
*   If either Alice or Bob wants to claim rewards, all they need to do is make sure the 100 `wCVX` tokens are in their account upon calling `getReward()`. Afterwards, the tokens can be transferred out.

#### Tools Used

Manual code review.
Discussion/confirmation with the Yield Protocol team.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function as shown in the [reference](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L395-L397) contract. However, it is important to ensure the wrapper contract and collateral vaults are excluded from the checkpointing so they are not considered in the rewards calculations.

## [[H-02] Malicious Users Can Transfer Vault Collateral To Other Accounts To Extract Additional Yield From The Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/89)
_Submitted by leastwood_

`ConvexYieldWrapper.sol` is a wrapper contract for staking convex tokens on the user's behalf, allowing them to earn rewards on their deposit. Users will interact with the `Ladle.sol` contract's `batch()` function which:

*   Approves Ladle to move the tokens.
*   Transfers the tokens to `ConvexYieldWrapper.sol`.
*   Wraps/stakes these tokens.
*   Updates accounting and produces debt tokens within `Ladle.sol`.

`_getDepositedBalance()` takes into consideration the user's total collateral stored in all of their owned vaults. However, as a vault owner, you are allowed to give the vault to another user, move collateral between vaults and add/remove collateral. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the result of this function by checkpointing one user's balance at a given time, transferring ownership to another user and then create a new checkpoint with this user.

As a result, a user is able to generate protocol yield multiple times over on a single collateral amount. This can be abused to effectively extract all protocol yield.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider the following exploit scenario:

*   Alice owns a vault which has 100 tokens worth of collateral.
*   At that point in time, `_getDepositedBalance()` returns 100 as its result. A checkpoint has also been made on this balance, giving Alice claim to her fair share of the rewards.
*   Alice then calls `Ladle.give()`, transferring the ownership of the vault to Bob and calls `ConvexYieldWrapper.addVault()`.
*   Bob is able to call `user_checkpoint()` and effectively update their checkpointed balance.
*   At this point in time, both Alice and Bob have claim to any yield generated by the protocol, however, there is only one vault instance that holds the underlying collateral.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexYieldWrapper.sol#L100-L120>
```solidity
function _getDepositedBalance(address account_) internal view override returns (uint256) {
    if (account_ == address(0) || account_ == collateralVault) {
        return 0;
    }

    bytes12[] memory userVault = vaults[account_];

    //add up all balances of all vaults registered in the wrapper and owned by the account
    uint256 collateral;
    DataTypes.Balances memory balance;
    uint256 userVaultLength = userVault.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userVaultLength; i++) {
        if (cauldron.vaults(userVault[i]).owner == account_) {
            balance = cauldron.balances(userVault[i]);
            collateral = collateral + balance.ink;
        }
    }

    //add to balance of this token
    return _balanceOf[account_] + collateral;
}
```

#### Tools Used

Manual code review.
Discussion/confirmation with the Yield Protocol team.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that any change to a vault will correctly checkpoint the previous and new vault owner. The affected actions include but are not limited to; transferring ownership of a vault to a new account, transferring collateral to another vault and adding/removing collateral to/from a vault.

 > The warden identified a way to sidestep the accounting in the `ConvexYieldWrapper`.
> 
> Because `ConvexYieldWrapper` takes lazy accounting, transferring vaults at the `Ladle` level allows to effectively register the same vault under multiple accounts, which ultimately allow to steal more yield than expected.
> 
> While the loss of yield can be classified as a medium severity, the fact that the warden was able to break the accounting invariants of the `ConvexYieldWrapper` leads me to raise the severity to high
> 
> Ultimately mitigation will require to `_checkpoint` also when vault operations happen (especially transfer), this may require a rethinking at the Ladle level as the reason why the warden was able to sidestep the checkpoint is because the `Ladle` doesn't notify the `Wrapper` of any vault transfers

**[alcueca (Yield) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/89#issuecomment-1046642319):**
 > Yes, that's right. To fix this issue we will deploy a separate Ladle to deal specifically with convex tokens. The fix will probably involve removing `stir` and `give` instead of notifying the wrapper, but we'll see.

# Medium Risk Findings (2)
## [[M-01] Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/136)
_Submitted by throttle, also found by 0x1f8b, cccz, defsec, hack3r-0m, hyh, kenzo, leastwood, sirhashalot, TomFrenchBlockchain, WatchPug, and ye0lde_

Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `quoteAmount` return value

#### Proof of Concept

Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price and round completeness.
Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `quoteAmount` return value

```javascript
function _peek(
    bytes6 base,
    bytes6 quote,
    uint256 baseAmount
) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 updateTime) {
    ...

    (, int256 daiPrice, , , ) = DAI.latestRoundData();
    (, int256 usdcPrice, , , ) = USDC.latestRoundData();
    (, int256 usdtPrice, , , ) = USDT.latestRoundData();

    require(
        daiPrice > 0 && usdcPrice > 0 && usdtPrice > 0,
        "Chainlink pricefeed reporting 0"
    );

    ...
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Validate data feed

```javascript
function _peek(
    bytes6 base,
    bytes6 quote,
    uint256 baseAmount
) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 updateTime) {
    ...
    (uint80 roundID, int256 daiPrice, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = DAI.latestRoundData();
    require(daiPrice > 0, "ChainLink: DAI price <= 0");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
    require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");

    (roundID, int256 usdcPrice, , timestamp, answeredInRound) = USDC.latestRoundData();
    require(usdcPrice > 0, "ChainLink: USDC price <= 0");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale USDC price");
    require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: USDC round not complete");

    (roundID, int256 usdtPrice, , timestamp, answeredInRound) = USDT.latestRoundData();
    require(usdtPrice > 0, "ChainLink: USDT price <= 0");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale USDT price");
    require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: USDT round not complete");

    ...
}
```

## [[M-02] Rewards distribution can be disrupted by a early user](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/116)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/e946f40239b33812e54fafc700eb2298df1a2579/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L206-L224>

```solidity
function _calcRewardIntegral(
    uint256 _index,
    address[2] memory _accounts,
    uint256[2] memory _balances,
    uint256 _supply,
    bool _isClaim
) internal {
    RewardType storage reward = rewards[_index];

    uint256 rewardIntegral = reward.reward_integral;
    uint256 rewardRemaining = reward.reward_remaining;

    //get difference in balance and remaining rewards
    //getReward is unguarded so we use reward_remaining to keep track of how much was actually claimed
    uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.reward_token).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (_supply > 0 && (bal - rewardRemaining) > 0) {
        rewardIntegral = uint128(rewardIntegral) + uint128(((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply);
        reward.reward_integral = uint128(rewardIntegral);
    }
```

`reward.reward_integral` is `uint128`, if a early user mint (wrap) just `1` Wei of `convexToken`, and make `_supply == 1`, and then tranferring `5e18` of `reward_token` to the contract.

As a result, `reward.reward_integral` can exceed `type(uint128).max` and overflow, causing the rewards distribution to be disrupted.

##### Recommendation

Consider `wrap` a certain amount of initial totalSupply, e.g. `1e8`, and never burn it. And consider using uint256 instead of uint128 for `reward.reward_integral`. Also, consdier lower `1e20` down to `1e12`.

**[alcueca (Yield) confirmed but disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield-findings/issues/116#issuecomment-1028062625):**
 > Assets are not a direct risk if it is the first user disrupting the contract. We would need to redeploy better code, but that's it. I suggest this is reported as medium, as merits for a DoS attack.
> 
> As suggested elsewhere, the right solution if uint128 is to be used in storage, is to cast up to uint256 for calculations, and then back to uint128 to store again.

 > The warden identified a way an early depositor can grief the system, I believe the finding to be valid, and because:
