# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Maple Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between December 2â€”December 8 2021.

Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 5 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 7 non-critical recommendations and 10 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review is linked in the [C4 Maple Finance contest repository README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple#audit-scope).

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)

## [[H-01] `makePayment()` Lack of access control allows malicious `lender` to retrieve a large portion of the funds earlier, making the borrower suffer fund loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/56)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[`MapleLoan.sol` L86-L93](https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/9684bcef06481e493d060974b1777a4517c4e792/contracts/MapleLoan.sol#L86-L93)

```solidity
function makePayment(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {
    // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.
    require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:MP:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");

    ( principal_, interest_ ) = _makePayment();

    emit PaymentMade(principal_, interest_);
}
```

The current implementation allows anyone to call `makePayment()` and repay the loan with `_drawableFunds`.

This makes it possible for a malicious `lender` to call `makePayment()` multiple times right after `fundLoan()` and retrieve most of the funds back immediately, while then `borrower` must continue to make payments or lose the `collateral`.

##### PoC

Given:

*   `_collateralRequired` = 1 BTC
*   `_principalRequested` = 12,000 USDC
*   `_paymentInterval` = 30 day
*   `_paymentsRemaining` = 12
*   `_gracePeriod` = 1 day
*   `interestRate_` = 2e17

1.  The borrower calls `postCollateral()` and added `1 BTC` as `_collateralAsset`;
2.  The lender calls `fundLoan()` and added `12,000 USDC` as  `_fundsAsset`;
3.  The lender calls `makePayment()` 11 times, then:

*   `_drawableFunds` = 96
*   `_claimableFunds` = 11903
*   `_principal` = 1553

4.  The lender calls `_claimFunds()` get 11,903 USDC of `_fundsAsset` back;

Now, for the borrower `1,579 USDC` is due, but only `96 USDC` can be used. The borrower is now forced to pay the interests for the funds that never be used or lose the collateral.

##### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function makePayment(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {
    // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.
    require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:MP:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");

    require(msg.sender == _borrower, "ML:DF:NOT_BORROWER");

    ( principal_, interest_ ) = _makePayment();

    emit PaymentMade(principal_, interest_);
}
```

**[deluca-mike (Maple) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/56#issuecomment-989565363):**
 > Good catch. However, we do want accounts other than the borrower to make payments (this is actually functionality that our current borrowers use), so instead of this fix, we may enforce that a payment can only be made some window of time before it is due, to prevent anyone from prematurely paying it down.

**[pauliax (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/56#issuecomment-997433285):**
 > Great find, with a POC, deserves a severity of high as it may incur in funds lost for the borrower. The sponsor has acknowledged and mitigated the issue.


# Medium Risk Findings (2)

## [[M-01] Anyone can call `closeLoan()` to close the loan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[`MapleLoan.sol` L56-L63](https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/9684bcef06481e493d060974b1777a4517c4e792/contracts/MapleLoan.sol#L56-L63)

```solidity
function closeLoan(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {
    // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.
    require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:CL:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");

    ( principal_, interest_ ) = _closeLoan();

    emit LoanClosed(principal_, interest_);
}
```

Based on the context, we believe that the `closeLoan()` should only be called by the `borrower`. However, the current implementation allows anyone to call `closeLoan()` anytime after `fundLoan()`.

If there is no `earlyFee`, this enables a griefing attack, causing the `borrower` and `lender` to abandon this contract and redo everything which costs more gas.

If a platform fee exits, the lender will also suffer fund loss from the platform fee charged in `fundLoan()`.

##### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function closeLoan(uint256 amount_) external override returns (uint256 principal_, uint256 interest_) {
    // The amount specified is an optional amount to be transfer from the caller, as a convenience for EOAs.
    require(amount_ == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transferFrom(_fundsAsset, msg.sender, address(this), amount_), "ML:CL:TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED");

    require(msg.sender == _borrower, "ML:DF:NOT_BORROWER");

    ( principal_, interest_ ) = _closeLoan();

    emit LoanClosed(principal_, interest_);
}
```

## [[M-02] Unsafe implementation of `fundLoan()` allows attacker to steal collateral from an unfunded loan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[`MapleLoanInternals.sol` L257-L273](https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/9684bcef06481e493d060974b1777a4517c4e792/contracts/MapleLoanInternals.sol#L257-L273)

```solidity
uint256 treasuryFee = (fundsLent_ * ILenderLike(lender_).treasuryFee() * _paymentInterval * _paymentsRemaining) / uint256(365 days * 10_000);

// Transfer delegate fee, if any, to the pool delegate, and decrement drawable funds.
uint256 delegateFee = (fundsLent_ * ILenderLike(lender_).investorFee() * _paymentInterval * _paymentsRemaining) / uint256(365 days * 10_000);

// Drawable funds is the amount funded, minus any fees.
_drawableFunds = fundsLent_ - treasuryFee - delegateFee;

require(
    treasuryFee == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transfer(_fundsAsset, ILenderLike(lender_).mapleTreasury(), treasuryFee),
    "MLI:FL:T_TRANSFER_FAILED"
);

require(
    delegateFee == uint256(0) || ERC20Helper.transfer(_fundsAsset, ILenderLike(lender_).poolDelegate(), delegateFee),
    "MLI:FL:PD_TRANSFER_FAILED"
    );
```

In the current implementation, `mapleTreasury`, `poolDelegate` and `treasuryFee` are taken from user input `lender_`, which can be faked by setting up a contract with `ILenderLike` interfaces.

This allows the attacker to set very high fees, making `_drawableFunds` near 0.

Since `mapleTreasury` and `poolDelegate` are also read from `lender_`, `treasuryFee` and `investorFee` can be retrieved back to the attacker.

As a result, the borrower won't get any `_drawableFunds` while also being unable to remove collateral.

##### PoC

Given:

*   `_collateralRequired` = 10 BTC
*   `_principalRequested` = 1,000,000 USDC
*   `_paymentInterval` = 1 day
*   `_paymentsRemaining` = 10
*   `_gracePeriod` = 1 day

1.  Alice (borrower) calls `postCollateral()` and added `10 BTC` as `_collateralAsset`;
2.  The attacker calls `fundLoan()` by taking `1,000,000 USDC` of flashloan and using a fake `lender`contract;
3.  Alice calls `drawdownFunds()` with any amount > 0 will fail;
4.  Alice calls `removeCollateral()` with any amount > 0 will get "MLI:DF:INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL" error;
5.  Unless Alice make payment (which is meaningless), after 2 day, the attacker can call `repossess()` and get `10 BTC`.

##### Recommendation

Consider reading `treasuryFee`, `investorFee`, `mapleTreasury`, `poolDelegate` from an authoritative source instead.

**[lucas-manuel (Maple) confirmed and disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/47#issuecomment-989304172):**
 > We would consider this medium risk, since a borrower would never post collateral before a loan is funded. We can enforce this on the smart contracts level though by adding a require to the `postCollateral` function to assert that the principal amount is greater than zero.

**[pauliax (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-maple-findings/issues/47#issuecomment-997435819):**
 > Great find. As per the sponsor's recommendation, this scenario is not very likely, so I am marking this issue as of medium severity.
