# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the InsureDAO smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 7â€”13, 2022.

# High Risk Findings (14)
## [[H-01] Tokens can be burned with no access control](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/158)
_Submitted by sirhashalot_


The Vault.sol contract has two address state variables, the `keeper` variable and the `controller` variable, which are both permitted to be the zero address. If both variables are zero simultaneously, any address can burn the available funds (available funds = balance - totalDebt) by sending these tokens to the zero address with the unprotected `utilitize()` function. If a user has no totalDebt, the user can lose their entire underlying token balance because of this.

#### Proof of Concept

The problematic `utilize()` function is [found here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L342-L352). To see how the two preconditions can occur:

1.  The keeper state variable is only changed by the `setKeeper()` function [found here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L502). If this function is not called, the keeper variable will retain the default value of address(0), which bypasses [the only access control for the utilize function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L344).
2.  There is a comment [here on line 69](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L502https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L502) stating the controller state variable can be zero. There is no zero address check for the controller state variable in the Vault constructor.

If both address variables are left at their defaults of `address(0)`, then the `safeTransfer()` call [on line 348](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L348) would send the tokens to address(0).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following line to the very beginning of the `utilize()` function:
`require(address(controller) != address(0))`

This check is already found in many other functions in Vault.sol, including the `_unutilize()` function.

## [[H-02] Typo in PoolTemplate unlock function results in user being able to unlock multiple times](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/192)
_Submitted by loop, also found by p4st13r4 and ye0lde_

The function `unlock()` in PoolTemplate has a typo where it compares `insurances[_id].status` to `false` rather than setting it to `false`. If the conditions are met to unlock the funds for an id, the user should be able to call the `unlock()` function once for that id as `insurances[_id].amount` is subtracted from `lockedAmount`. However, since `insurances[_id].status` does not get set to `false`, a user can call `unlock()` multiple times for the same id, resulting in `lockedAmount` being way smaller than it should be since `insurances[_id].amount` is subtracted multiple times.

#### Impact

`lockedAmount` is used to calculate the amount of underlying tokens available for withdrawals. If `lockedAmount` is lower than it should be users are able to withdraw more underlying tokens than available for withdrawals.

#### Proof of Concept

Typo in `unlock()`:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L360-L362>

Calculation of underlying tokens available for withdrawal:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L836>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `insurances[_id].status == false;` to `insurances[_id].status = false;`

## [[H-03] Malicious Market Creators Can Steal Tokens From Unsuspecting Approved Reference Accounts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/224)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The current method of market creation involves calling `Factory.createMarket()` with a list of approved `_conditions` and `_references` accounts. If a registered template address has `templates[address(_template)].isOpen == true`, then any user is able to call `createMarket()` using this template. If the template points to `PoolTemplate.sol`, then a malicious market creator can abuse `PoolTemplate.initialize()` as it makes a vault deposit from an account that they control. The vulnerable internal function, `_depositFrom()`, makes a vault deposit from the `_references[4]` address (arbitrarily set to an approved reference address upon market creation).

Hence, if approved `_references` accounts have set an unlimited approval amount for `Vault.sol` before deploying their market, a malicious user can frontrun market creation and cause these tokens to be transferred to the incorrect market.

This issue can cause honest market creators to have their tokens transferred to an incorrectly configured market, leading to unrecoverable funds. If their approval to `Vault.sol` was set to the unlimited amount, malicious users will also be able to force honest market creators to transfer more tokens than they would normally want to allow.

#### Tools Used

Manual code review.
Discussions with kohshiba.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

After discussions with the sponsor, they have opted to parse a `_creator` address to `PoolTemplate.sol` which will act as the depositor and be set to `msg.sender` in `Factory.createMarket()`. This will prevent malicious market creators from forcing vault deposits from unsuspecting users who are approved in `Factory.sol` and have also approved `Vault.sol` to make transfers on their behalf.

## [[H-04] Initial pool deposit can be stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/250)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug_

Note that the `PoolTemplate.initialize` function, called when creating a market with `Factory.createMarket`, calls a vault function to transfer an initial deposit amount (`conditions[1]`) *from* the initial depositor (`_references[4]`):

```solidity
// PoolTemplate
function initialize(
     string calldata _metaData,
     uint256[] calldata _conditions,
     address[] calldata _references
) external override {
     // ...

     if (_conditions[1] > 0) {
          // @audit vault calls asset.transferFrom(_references[4], vault, _conditions[1])
          _depositFrom(_conditions[1], _references[4]);
     }
}

function _depositFrom(uint256 _amount, address _from)
     internal
     returns (uint256 _mintAmount)
{
     require(
          marketStatus == MarketStatus.Trading && paused == false,
          "ERROR: DEPOSIT_DISABLED"
     );
     require(_amount > 0, "ERROR: DEPOSIT_ZERO");

     _mintAmount = worth(_amount);
     // @audit vault calls asset.transferFrom(_from, vault, _amount)
     vault.addValue(_amount, _from, address(this));

     emit Deposit(_from, _amount, _mintAmount);

     //mint iToken
     _mint(_from, _mintAmount);
}
```

The initial depositor needs to first approve the vault contract for the `transferFrom` to succeed.

An attacker can then frontrun the `Factory.createMarket` transaction with their own market creation (it does not have access restrictions) and create a market *with different parameters* but still passing in `_conditions[1]=amount` and `_references[4]=victim`.

A market with parameters that the initial depositor did not want (different underlying, old whitelisted registry/parameter contract, etc.) can be created with their tokens and these tokens are essentially lost.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Can the initial depositor be set to `Factory.createMarket`'s `msg.sender`, instead of being able to pick a whitelisted one as `_references[4]`?

## [[H-05] backdoor in `withdrawRedundant`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/252)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by camden, WatchPug, and Ruhum_

The `Vault.withdrawRedundant` has wrong logic that allows the admins to steal the underlying vault token.

```solidity
function withdrawRedundant(address _token, address _to)
     external
     override
     onlyOwner
{
     if (
          _token == address(token) &&
          balance < IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))
     ) {
          uint256 _redundant = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) -
               balance;
          IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_to, _redundant);
     } else if (IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
          // @audit they can rug users. let's say balance == IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) => first if false => transfers out everything
          IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
               _to,
               IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))
          );
     }
}
```

###### POC

*   Vault deposits increase as `Vault.addValue` is called and the `balance` increases by `_amount` as well as the actual `IERC20(token).balanceOf(this)`. Note that `balance == IERC20(token).balanceOf(this)`
*   Admins call `vault.withdrawRedundant(vault.token(), attacker)` which goes into the `else if` branch due to the balance inequality condition being `false`. It will transfer out all `vault.token()` amounts to the attacker.

#### Impact

There's a backdoor in the `withdrawRedundant` that allows admins to steal all user deposits.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think the devs wanted this logic from the code instead:

```solidity
function withdrawRedundant(address _token, address _to)
     external
     override
     onlyOwner
{
     if (
          _token == address(token)
     ) {
          if (balance < IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))) {
               uint256 _redundant = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) -
                    balance;
               IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_to, _redundant);
          }
     } else if (IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
          IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
               _to,
               IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))
          );
     }
}
```

## [[H-06] the first depositor to a pool can drain all users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/263)
_Submitted by danb_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L807>
if there is no liquidity in the pool, the first deposit determines the total liquidity, if the amount is too small the minted liquidity for the next liquidity providers will round down to zero.

#### Impact

An attacker can steal all money from liquidity providers.

#### Proof of Concept

consider the following scenario:
a pool is created.
the attacker is the first one to deposit, they deposit with \_amount == 1, the smallest amount possible. meaning the total liquidity is 1.
then they join another pool in order to get attributions in the vault.
they transfer the attributions to the pool using `transferAttribution`.
for example, they transferred 1M dollar worth of attributions.
the next person deposits in the index, for example, 500,000 dollars.
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L803>
the amount they will get is:

    _amount = (_value * _supply) / _originalLiquidity;

as we know:
\_amount = 500,000 dollar
\_supply = 1
\_totalLiquidity = 1,000,000 dollar (the attacker transferred directly)
the investor will get (500,000 dollar \* 1) / (1,000,000 dollar) = 0
and they will pay 500,000
this money will go to the index, and the attacker holds all of the shares, so they can withdraw it and get 1,500,000 stealing 500,000 dollars from the second investor.

## [[H-07] Wrong design/implementation of permission control allows malicious/compromised Registry or Factory admin to steal funds from users' wallet balances](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/266)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

The current design/implementation allows a `market` address (registered on `registry`) to call `Vault#addValue()` and transfer tokens from an arbitrary address to a specified `_beneficiary` up the approved amount at any time, and the `_beneficiary` can withdraw the funds by calling `Vault#withdrawAllAttribution()` immediately.

This poses a very dangerous risk to all the users that approved their tokens to the Vault contracts (each one holds all users' allowances for that token).

Registry owner can call `Registry#supportMarket()` and mark an arbitrary address as a `market`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Registry.sol#L49-L60>

```solidity
function supportMarket(address _market) external override {
    require(!markets[_market], "ERROR: ALREADY_REGISTERED");
    require(
        msg.sender == factory || msg.sender == ownership.owner(),
        "ERROR: UNAUTHORIZED_CALLER"
    );
    require(_market != address(0), "ERROR: ZERO_ADDRESS");

    allMarkets.push(_market);
    markets[_market] = true;
    emit NewMarketRegistered(_market);
}
```

Or, the owner of the Factory can call `createMarket()` to add a malicous market contract via a custom template contract to the `markets` list.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Factory.sol#L214-L216>

#### Proof of Concept

A malicious/compromised Registry owner can:

1.  Call `Registry#supportMarket()` and set `markets[attackerAddress]` to `true`;
2.  Call `Vault#addValue(token.balanceOf(victimAddress), victimAddress, attackerAddress)` and transferring all the balanceOf victim's wallet to the vault, owned by `attackerAddress`.
3.  Call `Vault#withdrawAllAttribution(attackerAddress)` and retrive the funds.

The malicious/compromised Registry owner can repeat the steps above for all the users who approved the Vault contract for all the Vault contracts.

As a result, the attacker can steal all the wallet balances of the tokens approved to the protocol.

#### Root Cause

Improper access control for using users' allowances.

#### Recommendation

Consider changing the design/implementation to make sure that the allowances approved by the users can only be used by themselves.

## [[H-08] `IndexTemplate.sol#compensate()` will most certainly fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/269)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

Precision loss while converting between `the amount of shares` and `the amount of underlying tokens` back and forth is not handled properly.

***

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/IndexTemplate.sol#L438-L447>

```solidity
uint256 _shortage;
if (totalLiquidity() < _amount) {
    //Insolvency case
    _shortage = _amount - _value;
    uint256 _cds = ICDSTemplate(registry.getCDS(address(this)))
        .compensate(_shortage);
    _compensated = _value + _cds;
}
vault.offsetDebt(_compensated, msg.sender);
```

In the current implementation, when someone tries to resume the market after a pending period ends by calling `PoolTemplate.sol#resume()`, `IndexTemplate.sol#compensate()` will be called internally to make a payout. If the index pool is unable to cover the compensation, the CDS pool will then be used to cover the shortage.

However, while `CDSTemplate.sol#compensate()` takes a parameter for the amount of underlying tokens, it uses `vault.transferValue()` to transfer corresponding `_attributions` (shares) instead of underlying tokens.

Due to precision loss, the `_attributions` transferred in the terms of underlying tokens will most certainly be less than the shortage.

At L444, the contract believes that it's been compensated for `_value + _cds`, which is lower than the actual value, due to precision loss.

At L446, when it calls `vault.offsetDebt(_compensated, msg.sender)`, the tx will revert at `require(underlyingValue(msg.sender) >= _amount)`.

As a result, `resume()` can not be done, and the debt can't be repaid.

##### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   vault.underlyingValue = 10,000
*   vault.valueAll = 30,000
*   totalAttributions = 2,000,000
*   \_amount = 1,010,000

0.  \_shortage = \_amount - vault.underlyingValue = 1,000,000
1.  \_attributions = (\_amount \* totalAttributions) / valueAll = 67,333,333
2.  actualValueTransfered = (valueAll \* \_attributions) / totalAttributions = 1009999

**Expected results**: actualValueTransfered = \_shortage;

**Actual results**: actualValueTransfered < \_shortage.

#### Impact

The precision loss isn't just happening on special numbers, but will most certainly always revert the txs.

This will malfunction the contract as the index pool can not `compensate()`, therefore the pool can not `resume()`. Causing the funds of the LPs of the pool and the index pool to be frozen, and other stakeholders of the same vault will suffer fund loss from an unfair share of the funds compensated before.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

        .compensate(_shortage);
    _compensated = vault.underlyingValue(address(this));

    } else {
        controller = IController(_controller);
    }

    emit ControllerSet(_controller);
}
```

The owner of the Vault contract can set an arbitrary address as the `controller`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L342-L352>

        balance -= _amount;
        controller.earn(address(token), _amount);
    }
}
```

A malicious `controller` contract can transfer funds from the Vault to the attacker.

#### Proof of Concept

A malicious/compromised can:

1.  Call `Vault#setController()` and set `controller` to a malicious contract;
    *   L489 the old controller will transfer funds to the new, malicious controller.
2.  Call `Vault#utilize()` to deposit all the balance in the Vault contract into the malicious controller contract.
3.  Withdraw all the funds from the malicious controller contract.

#### Recommendation

Consider disallowing `Vault#setController()` to set a new address if a controller is existing, which terminates the possibility of migrating funds to a specified address provided by the owner. Or, putting a timelock to this function at least.

See the PoC section on \[WP-H24].

2.  Consdier adding constrains (upper bound for each pool, and index pool for example) to `Vault#borrowValue()`.

// _redeemAmount = 16666666666666666666667 (~ 16,666 * 10**18)

In most cases, the transaction will revet on underflow at:
```solidity
uint256 _shortage = _deductionFromIndex /
    MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 -
    _actualDeduction;
```
In some cases, specific pools will be liable for unfair compensation:

If the CSD is empty, `Index Pool 1` only have `6,000 * 10**18` and `Index Pool 2` only have `4,000 * 10**18`, the `_actualDeduction` will be `10,000 * 10**18`, `_deductionFromPool` will be `0`.

`Index Pool 1` should only pay `1,000 * 10**18`, but actually paid `6,000 * 10**18`, the LPs of `Index Pool 1` now suffer funds loss.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity

Based on the context, the system intends to lock all the lps during PayingOut period.

However, the current implementation allows anyone, including LPs to call `resume()` and unlock the index pool.

It allows a malicious LP to escape the responsibility for the compensation, at the expense of other LPs paying more than expected.

_Submitted by WatchPug_

In the current implementation, when an incident is reported for a certain pool, the index pool can still `withdrawCredit()` from the pool, which in the best interest of an index pool, the admin of the index pool is preferred to do so.

This allows the index pool to escape from the responsibility for the risks of invested pools.

Making the LPs of the pool take an unfair share of the responsibility.

##### Proof of Concept

*   Pool A `totalCredit` = 10,000
*   Pool A `rewardPerCredit` = 1

1.  \[Index Pool 1] allocates 1,000 credits to Pool `A`:

*   `totalCredit` = 11,000
*   indicies\[Index Pool 1] = 1,000

2.  After a while, Pool A `rewardPerCredit` has grown to `1.1`, and `applyCover()` has been called, \[Index Pool 1] call `withdrawCredit()` get 100 premium

*   `totalCredit` = 10,000
*   indicies\[Index Pool 1] = 0

3.  After `pendingEnd`, the pool `resume()`,\[ Index Pool 1] will not be paying for the compensation since `credit` is 0.

In our case, \[Index Pool 1] earned premium without paying for a part of the compensation.

# Medium Risk Findings (9)
## [[M-01] repayDebt in Vault.sol could DOS functionality for markets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/126)
_Submitted by p4st13r4_

Any user can pay the debt for any borrower in `Vault.sol`, by using `repayDebt()`. This function allows anyone to repay any amount of borrowed value, up-to and including the `totalDebt` value; it works by setting the `debts[_target]` to zero, and decreasing `totalDebt` by the given amount, up to zero. However, all debts of the other borrowers are left untouched.

If a malicious (but generous) user were to repay the debt for all the borrowers, markets functionality regarding borrowing would be DOSed: the vault would try to decrease the debt of the market, successfully, but would fail to decrease `totalDebt` as it would result in an underflow

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/main/contracts/Vault.sol#L257>


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

_Submitted by camden_

The owner could potentially extend the insurance period indefinitely in the `applyCover` function without ever allowing the market to resume. This is because there is no check in `applyCover` to ensure that the market is in a `Trading` state.

This can also allow the owner to emit fraudulent `MarketStatusChanged` events.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Require that the market be in a `Trading` state to allow another `applyCover` call.

## [[M-03] Signature replay](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/184)
_Submitted by 0x1f8b_

Signature replay in `PoolTemplate`.

#### Proof of Concept

The `redeem` method of `PoolTemplate` verifies the data stored in `incident`, and the verification logic of this process is performed as following:
```solidity
require(
    MerkleProof.verify(
        _merkleProof,
        _targets,
        keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, _insurance.insured)
        )
    ) ||
        MerkleProof.verify(
            _merkleProof,
            _targets,
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_insurance.target, address(0)))
        ),
    "ERROR: INSURANCE_EXEMPTED"
);
```

As can be seen, the only data related to the `_insurance` are`  target ` and `insured`, so as the incident has no relation with the`  Insurance `, apparently nothing prevents a user to call `insure` with high amounts, after receive the incident, the only thing that prevents this from being reused is that the owner creates the incident with an `_incidentTimestamp` from the past.

So if an owner create a incident from the future it's possible to create a new `insure` that could be reused by the same affected address.

Another lack of input verification that could facilitate this attack is the `_span=0` in the `insure` method.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is mandatory to add a check in `applyCover` that`  _incidentTimestamp ` is less than the current date and the `span` argument is greater than 0 in the`  insure ` method.

## [[M-04] System Debt Is Not Handled When Insurance Pools Become Insolvent](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/228)
_Submitted by leastwood_

If an incident has occurred where an insurance policy is to be redeemed. The market is put into the `MarketStatus.Payingout` mode where the `_insurance.insured` account is allowed to redeem their cover and receive a payout amount. Upon paying out the insurance cover, any user is able to resume the market by calling `PoolTemplate.resume()`. This function will compensate the insurance pool if it is insolvent by querying `IndexTemplate.compensate()` which in turn queries `CDSTemplate.compensate()` to cover any shortage.

In the event none of these entities are able to cover the shortage in debt, the system accrues the debt. However, there is currently no mechanism to ensure when `transferDebt()` is called in `PoolTemplate.resume()`, the accrued system debt is paid off. Therefore, the system may incorrectly handle insolvency on an extreme edge case, generating system instability.

#### Proof of Concept

    );

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider devising a mechanism to ensure system debt is properly handled. After discussions with the sponsor, it seems that they will be implementing a way to mint `INSURE` tokens which will be used to cover the shortfall.

**[oishun1112 (Insure) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/228)**
 > yes, PoolTemplate calls transferDebt() to make his debt to the system debt in case all Index and CDS layers couldn't cover the shortage.
> In this case, we have to repay the system debt somehow since this is the situation that we over-lose money. One way is that someone calls repayDebt() and pay for it (not realistic at all). As we implement the way to payback, we are considering minting INSURE token or, other better mechanism.

## [[M-05] `Vault.sol` Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/236)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by pmerkleplant, cmichel, Ruhum, and Dravee_

There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` / `transferFrom()`.

`Vault.sol#addValue()` assumes that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, and uses it to calculate attributions, balance amounts, etc. While the actual transferred amount can be lower for those tokens.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L124-L140>

```solidity
function addValue(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _from,
    address _beneficiary
) external override onlyMarket returns (uint256 _attributions) {

    if (totalAttributions == 0) {
        _attributions = _amount;
    } else {
        uint256 _pool = valueAll();
        _attributions = (_amount * totalAttributions) / _pool;
    }
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
    balance += _amount;
    totalAttributions += _attributions;
    attributions[_beneficiary] += _attributions;
}
```

#### Recommendation

Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.

## [[M-06] Index compensate is 0 when totalLiquidity() is enough to cover the whole amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/354)
_Submitted by pauliax_

In IndexTemplate, function compensate, When `\_amount > \_value`, and `<= totalLiquidity()`, the value of `\_compensated` is not set, so it gets a default value of 0:

```solidity
if (_value >= _amount) {
    ...
    _compensated = _amount;
} else {
    ...
    if (totalLiquidity() < _amount) {
        ...
        _compensated = _value + _cds;
    }
    vault.offsetDebt(_compensated, msg.sender);
}
```

But nevertheless, in both cases, it calls `vault.offsetDebt`, even when the`\_compensated` is 0 (no else block).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think, in this case, it should try to redeem the premium (withdrawCredit?) to cover the whole amount, but I am not sure about the intentions as I didn't have enough time to understand this protocol in depth.

## [[M-07] `requestWithdraw` without obligation to withdraw allow underwriter to avoid payout](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/295)
_Submitted by gzeon_

To prevent withdrawal front-running, a lockup period is set between withdrawal request and withdrawal. However, there are no obligation to withdraw after the lockup period and the capital will keep earning premium during lockup. A strategy for underwriter is to keep requesting withdrawal every `lockup period` to keep their average lockup to `lockup period/2`.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/PoolTemplate.sol#L279>

Assuming

1.  Reporting DAO vote last for 24 hours (according to docs) plus there will be delay between the hack and vote creation
2.  the `lockup period` is set to 86400 (24 hours) in the supplied test cases

It is very likely an underwriter can avoid payout by such strategy since their effective lockup would be 12 hours only. They will continue to earn yield in the pool and only require some extra gas cost for the `requestWithdraw` every 24 hours.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Extend the lockup period at least by a factor of 2 or force underwriter to withdraw after lockup period.


**[oishun1112 (Insure) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure-findings/issues/295):**

The transactions could fail if the array get too big and the transaction would consume more gas than the block limit.
This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.
