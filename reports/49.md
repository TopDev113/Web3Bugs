# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Overlay Protocol contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 16—November 22 2021.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 25 unique vulnerabilities and 68 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 9 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 14 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 7 non-critical recommendations and 36 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Overlay Protocol contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay), and is composed of 58 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 6155 lines of Solidity code.


# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] `OverlayV1UniswapV3Market` computes wrong market liquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/83)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `OverlayV1UniswapV3Market.fetchPricePoint` tries to compute the market depth in OVL terms as `marketLiquidity (in ETH) / ovlPrice (in ETH per OVL)`.
To get the market liquidity *in ETH* (and not the other token pair), it uses the `ethIs0` boolean.

```solidity
_marketLiquidity = ethIs0
    ? ( uint256(_liquidity) << 96 ) / _sqrtPrice
    : FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(_liquidity), _sqrtPrice, X96);
```

However, `ethIs0` boolean refers to the `ovlFeed`, whereas the `_liquidity` refers to the `marketFeed`, and therefore the `ethIs0` boolean has nothing to do with the *market* feed where the liquidity is taken from:

```solidity
// in constructor, if token0 is eth refers to ovlFeed
ethIs0 = IUniswapV3Pool(_ovlFeed).token0() == _eth;

// in fetchPricePoint, _liquidity comes from different market feed
( _ticks, _liqs ) = IUniswapV3Pool(marketFeed).observe(_secondsAgo);
_marketLiquidity = ethIs0
    ? ( uint256(_liquidity) << 96 ) / _sqrtPrice
    : FullMath.mulDiv(uint256(_liquidity), _sqrtPrice, X96);
```

#### Impact

If the `ovlFeed` and `marketFeed` do not have the same token position for the ETH pair (ETH is either token 0 or token 1 for **both** pairs), then the market liquidity & depth is computed wrong (inverted).
For example, the `OverlayV1Market.depth()` function will return a wrong depth which is used in the market cap computation.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It seems that `marketFeed.token0() == WETH` should be used in `fetchPricePoint` to compute the liquidity instead of `ovlFeed.token0() == WETH`.

**[realisation (Overlay) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/83#issuecomment-985656027):**

## [[H-02] OZ ERC1155Supply vulnerability](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/127)
_Submitted by pauliax, also found by hubble and defsec_

#### Impact

Overlay uses OZ contracts version 4.3.2:

```yaml
  dependencies:
    - OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2
```

and has a contract that inherits from ERC1155Supply:

```solidity
  contract OverlayV1OVLCollateral is ERC1155Supply
```

This version has a recently discovered vulnerability:
<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wmpv-c2jp-j2xg>

In your case, function unwind relies on totalSupply when calculating `\_userNotional`, `\_userDebt`, `\_userCost`, and `\_userOi`, so a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by first calling 'build' and then on callback 'unwind' in the same transaction before the total supply is updated.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider updating to a patched version of 4.3.3.

# Medium Risk Findings (9)
## [[M-01] isUnderwater returns opposite boolean for short positions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/53)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

#### Impact

The function `isUnderwater` should return true if the position value is < 0. In the case of a short position, this is when oi \* (2 - priceFrame) - debt < 0 (based on the logic given in the \_value function). Rearranging this equation, a short position is underwater if oi \* 2 < oi \* priceFrame + debt. However, in the function `\_isUnderwater` in Position.sol, the left and right side of this equation is flipped, meaning that the function will return the opposite of what it should when called on short positions.

Fortunately, the V1 implementation of `OverlayOVLCollateral` does not directly use the `isUnderwater` function in major control flow changes. However, line 304 of OverlayV1OVLCollateral.sol is a comment that says:

// TODO: think through edge case of underwater position ... and fee adjustments ...

which hints that this function is going to be used to deal with underwater positions. As a result, this issue would have a huge impact if not properly dealt with.

#### Proof of Concept

See code for `\_isUnderwater` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/1833b792caf3eb8756b1ba5f50f9c2ce085e54d0/contracts/libraries/Position.sol#L70>

Notice that for short positions the inequality is flipped from what it should be (indeed, when self.debt is higher it is more likely that `isUnder` will be false, which is obviously incorrect).

Also, see the TODO comment here that shows `isUnderwater` is important: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/1833b792caf3eb8756b1ba5f50f9c2ce085e54d0/contracts/collateral/OverlayV1OVLCollateral.sol#L304>

#### Tools Used

Inspection

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Flip the left and right side of the inequality for short positions in `\_isUnderwater`.

## [[M-02] pow() is missing check on input parameters with 0 value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/54)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact

The contract LogExpMath.sol seems to be a fork of the balancer LogExpMath.sol contract.
It is mostly similar, except for checks for x and y being 0 in the beginning of the function `pow()`, see below.

This omission might lead to unexpected results.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/libraries/LogExpMath.sol#L93-L110>

```JS
 function pow(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        unchecked {
        _require(x < 2**255, Errors.X_OUT_OF_BOUNDS);
```

<https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/solidity-utils/contracts/math/LogExpMath.sol#L93-L109>

```JS
function pow(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (y == 0) {
        // We solve the 0^0 indetermination by making it equal one.
        return uint256(ONE_18);
    }

    if (x == 0) {
        return 0;
    }      
    _require(x < 2**255, Errors.X_OUT_OF_BOUNDS);
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check if the extra code of the balance contract is useful and if so add it.

 > I disagree with sponsor regarding scope. The [Contracts section of the Contest Scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/tree/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c#contracts) lists several contracts which rely on `contracts/libraries/FixedPoint.sol`. This contract uses the `pow` function containing the issue described. The warden has not described an exact attack but has show a math issue, which can certainly lead to a hypothetical loss of funds. Medium severity is appropriate and sponsor should definitely fix this.



## [[M-03] Can't enableCollateral after a disableCollateral ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/55)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact

The function `disableCollateral` of OverlayV1Mothership.sol doesn't set `collateralActive\[\_collateral] = false;`
But it does revoke the roles.

Now `enableCollateral`  can never be used because `collateralActive\[\_collateral] ==true`  and it will never pass the second require.
So you can never grant the roles again.

Note: `enableCollateral` also doesn't set `collateralActive\[\_collateral] = true`

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/mothership/OverlayV1Mothership.sol#L133-L153>

```JS
function enableCollateral (address _collateral) external onlyGovernor {
    require(collateralExists[_collateral], "OVLV1:!exists");
    require(!collateralActive[_collateral], "OVLV1:!disabled");
    OverlayToken(ovl).grantRole(OverlayToken(ovl).MINTER_ROLE(), _collateral);
    OverlayToken(ovl).grantRole(OverlayToken(ovl).BURNER_ROLE(), _collateral);
}

function disableCollateral (address _collateral) external onlyGovernor {
    require(collateralActive[_collateral], "OVLV1:!enabled");
    OverlayToken(ovl).revokeRole(OverlayToken(ovl).MINTER_ROLE(), _collateral);
    OverlayToken(ovl).revokeRole(OverlayToken(ovl).BURNER_ROLE(), _collateral);
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In function `enableCollateral()` add the following (after the require):
`collateralActive\[\_collateral] = true;`

In function `disableCollateral` add the following (after the require):
`collateralActive\[\_collateral] = false;`

## [[M-04] _totalSupply not updated in _transferMint() and _transferBurn() ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/59)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by WatchPug, harleythedog, hubble, xYrYuYx, cmichel, and defsec_

#### Impact

The functions `\_transferMint()` and `\_transferBurn()` of OverlayToken.sol don't update `\_totalSupply`.
Whereas the similar functions `\_mint()` and `\_burn()` do update `\_totalSupply`.

This means that `\_totalSupply` and `totalSupply()` will not show a realistic view of the total OVL tokens.

For the protocol itself it isn't such a problem because this value isn't used in the protocol (as far as I can see).
But other protocols building on Overlay may use it, as well as user interfaces and analytic platforms.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/ovl/OverlayToken.sol#L349-L364>

```js
function _mint( address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
   ...
      _totalSupply += amount;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/ovl/OverlayToken.sol#L376-L395

```js
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
   ...
        _totalSupply -= amount;

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/ovl/OverlayToken.sol#L194-L212

https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/914bed22f190ebe7088194453bab08c424c3f70c/contracts/ovl/OverlayToken.sol#L268-L286
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Update `_totalSupply`  in `_transferMint()` and `_transferBurn()`

## [[M-05] Fee double counting for underwater positions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/134)
_Submitted by hyh_

#### Impact

Actual available fees are less than recorded. That's because a part of them corresponds to underwater positions, and will not have the correct amount stored with the contract: when calculation happens the fee is recorded first, then there is a check for position health, and the funds are channeled to cover the debt firsthand. This way in a case of unfunded position the fee is recorded, but cannot be allocated, so the fees accounted can be greater than the value of fees stored.

This can lead to fee withdrawal malfunction, i.e. `disburse()` will burn more and attempt to transfer more than needed. This leads either to inability to withdraw fees when disburse is failing due to lack of funds, or funds leakage to fees and then inability to perform other withdrawals because of lack of funds.

#### Proof of Concept

The fees are accounted for before position health check and aren't corrected thereafter when there is a shortage of funds.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/main/contracts/collateral/OverlayV1OVLCollateral.sol#L311>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Adjust fees after position health check: accrue fees only on a remaining part of position that is available after taking debt into account.

Now:
```solidity
uint _feeAmount = _userNotional.mulUp(mothership.fee());

uint _userValueAdjusted = _userNotional - _feeAmount;
if (_userValueAdjusted > _userDebt) _userValueAdjusted -= _userDebt;
else _userValueAdjusted = 0;
```
To be:
```solidity
uint _feeAmount = _userNotional.mulUp(mothership.fee());

uint _userValueAdjusted = _userNotional - _feeAmount;
if (_userValueAdjusted > _userDebt) {
    _userValueAdjusted -= _userDebt;
} else {
    _userValueAdjusted = 0;
    _feeAmount = _userNotional > _userDebt ? _userNotional - _userDebt : 0;
}
```

## [[M-06] Timelock and events for governor functions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/120)
_Submitted by pauliax_

#### Impact

There are contracts that contain functions that change important parameters of the system, e.g. `OverlayV1Mothership` has `setOVL`, `initializeMarket`, `disableMarket`, `enableMarket`, `initializeCollateral`, `enableCollateral`, `disableCollateral`, `adjustGlobalParams`. None of these functions emit events, nor they are timelocked. Usually, it is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to changes.

A similar issue was submitted in a previous contest and assigned a severity of Medium: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/101>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using a timelock for critical params of the system and emitting events to inform the outside world.

**[realisation (Overlay) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/120#issuecomment-978096272):**
 > The plan has been to have a timelock at some point in the protocol. Probably on whatever is the admin for the mothership. But this just had to be evaluated. It might be on the market contract itself, or on the addresses granted the role of admin.

 > I'm removing the duplicate in this case because issue #64 refers exclusively to the events. This issue is focused primarily on the lack of governance timelock, which has traditionally been considered a medium severity issue.



## [[M-07] Cached version of ovl may be outdated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/129)
_Submitted by pauliax_

#### Impact

contract OverlayV1OVLCollateral and OverlayV1Governance cache ovl address:

```solidity
IOverlayTokenNew immutable public ovl;
```

This variable is initialized in the constructor and fetched from the mothership contract:

```solidity
mothership = IOverlayV1Mothership(_mothership);
ovl = IOverlayV1Mothership(_mothership).ovl();
```

ovl is declared as immutable and later contract interacts with this cached version. However, mothership contains a setter function, so the governor can point it to a new address:

```solidity
function setOVL (address _ovl) external onlyGovernor {
    ovl = _ovl;
}
```

`OverlayV1OVLCollateral` and `OverlayV1Governance` will still use this old cached value.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider if this was intended, or you want to remove this cached version and always fetch on the go (this will increase the gas costs though).

## [[M-08] OverlayToken.burn function could burn tokens of any user](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/22)
_Submitted by xYrYuYx_

#### Impact

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/main/contracts/ovl/OverlayToken.sol#L366>

The burner could burn any amount of tokens of any user.
This is not good solution of burn

#### Tools Used

Manual

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update burn function for only owner can burn his tokens.
Now, `ovl.burn` function is used in OverlayV1OVLCollateral.sol file, and these updates won’t make any issue in protocol.

## [[M-09] Improper Upper Bound Definition on the Fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay-findings/issues/77)
_Submitted by defsec, also found by gzeon, nathaniel, WatchPug, cmichel,  and pauliax_

#### Impact

In the `adjustGlobalParams` function on line 1603 of "<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/main/contracts/mothership/OverlayV1Mothership.sol#L1630>", `adjustGlobalParams` function does not have any upper or lower bounds. Values that are too large will lead to reversions in several critical functions.

#### Proof of Concept

*   The `setFee` function that begins on line 163 of `adjustGlobalParams` sets the liquidity and transaction fee rates for the market in which the function is called. In this context, the transaction fee is the percentage of a transaction that is taken by the protocol and moved to a designated reserve account. As the name suggests, transaction fees factor in to many of the essential transaction types performed within the system.
*   Navigate to "<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-overlay/blob/main/contracts/mothership/OverlayV1Mothership.sol#L163>" contract and go to line #163.
*   On the function there is no upper and lower bound defined. Therefore, users can pay higher fees.

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider defining upper and lower bounds on the `adjustGlobalParams` function.
