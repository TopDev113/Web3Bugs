Overview
========


*Please note: Code4rena is an organization that puts learning at the forefront of everything we do. [Our rules and processes continue to develop over time](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues), and older reports may reflect previous iterations of these rules and processes. For a more current representation of Code4rena’s severity standardization rules and comprehensive judging criteria, we recommend browsing the reports from C4’s most recent contests.*


About C4
--------


Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.


A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.


During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Amun smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between December 13—December 19 2021.

High Risk Findings (2)
======================


[[H-01] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded, and can be stolen by attacker](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/201)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by WatchPug*


Under certain circumstances, e.g. `annualizedFee` being minted to `feeBeneficiary` between the time user sent the transaction and the transaction being packed into the block and causing amounts of underlying tokens for each basketToken to decrease. It’s possible or even most certainly that there will be some leftover basket underlying tokens, as `BasketFacet.sol#joinPool()` will only transfer required amounts of basket tokens from Join contracts.


However, in the current implementation, only the leftover inputToken is returned.


As a result, the leftover underlying tokens won’t be returned to the user, which constitutes users’ fund loss.


[`SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` L57-L78](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/cf890dedf2e43ec787e8e5df65726316fda134a1/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleTokenJoinV2.sol#L57-L78)



```
function joinTokenSingle(JoinTokenStructV2 calldata \_joinTokenStruct)
 external
{
 // ######## INIT TOKEN #########
 IERC20 inputToken = IERC20(\_joinTokenStruct.inputToken);

 inputToken.safeTransferFrom(
 msg.sender,
 address(this),
 \_joinTokenStruct.inputAmount
 );

 \_joinTokenSingle(\_joinTokenStruct);

 // ######## SEND TOKEN #########
 uint256 remainingIntermediateBalance = inputToken.balanceOf(
 address(this)
 );
 if (remainingIntermediateBalance > 0) {
 inputToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, remainingIntermediateBalance);
 }
}
```

[`BasketFacet.sol` L143-L168](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/cf890dedf2e43ec787e8e5df65726316fda134a1/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L143-L168)



```
function joinPool(uint256 \_amount, uint16 \_referral)
 external
 override
 noReentry
{
 require(!this.getLock(), "POOL\_LOCKED");
 chargeOutstandingAnnualizedFee();
 LibBasketStorage.BasketStorage storage bs =
 LibBasketStorage.basketStorage();
 uint256 totalSupply = LibERC20Storage.erc20Storage().totalSupply;
 require(
 totalSupply.add(\_amount) <= this.getCap(),
 "MAX\_POOL\_CAP\_REACHED"
 );

 uint256 feeAmount = \_amount.mul(bs.entryFee).div(10\*\*18);

 for (uint256 i; i < bs.tokens.length; i++) {
 IERC20 token = bs.tokens[i];
 uint256 tokenAmount =
 balance(address(token)).mul(\_amount.add(feeAmount)).div(
 totalSupply
 );
 require(tokenAmount != 0, "AMOUNT\_TOO\_SMALL");
 token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenAmount);
 }
 ...
```

Furthermore, the leftover tokens in the `SingleTokenJoinV2` contract can be stolen by calling `joinTokenSingle()` with fake `outputBasket` contract and `swap.exchange` contract.


##### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Consider:


1. Calling `IBasketFacet.calcTokensForAmount()` first and only swap for exactly the desired amounts of tokens (like `SingleTokenJoin.sol`);
2. Or, refund leftover tokens.

[[H-02] It might not be possible to withdraw tokens from the basket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/287)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by Czar102, also found by csanuragjain*


#### Impact


When enough basket token owners exit, it will be impossible to exit pool with the last `MIN_AMOUNT` tokens because of [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L228-L231) check. This will result in locking some tokens forever.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Consider resigning from this check or performing it only for the owner balance, who would need to have at least `MIN_AMOUNT` tokens.

Medium Risk Findings (10)
=========================


[[M-01] Function `joinTokenSingle` in `SingleTokenJoin.sol` and `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` can be made to fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/81)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by pmerkleplant, also found by certora, hyh, p4st13r4, pauliax, robee, and WatchPug*


#### Impact


There’s a griefing attack vulnerability in the function `joinTokenSingle` in
`SingleTokenJoin.sol` as well as `SingleTokenJoinV2.sol` which makes any user
transaction fail with “FAILED*OUTPUT*AMOUNT”.


##### Proof of Concept


The `JoinTokenStruct` argument for `joinTokenSingle` includes a field `outputAmount`
to indicate the amount of tokens the user should receive after joining a basket
(see line [135](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleTokenJoin.sol#L135) and [130](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleTokenJoinV2.sol#L130)).


However, this amount is compared to the contract’s balance of the token and
reverts if the amount is unequal.


If an attacker sends some amount of a basket’s token to the contract, every call
to this function will fail as long as the output token equals the attacker’s token send.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Refactor the `require` statement to expect at least the `outputAmount` of tokens,
i.e. `require(outputAmount >= _joinTokenStruct.outputAmount)`.

[[M-02] Unchecked return value from low-level call()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/237)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by JMukesh, also found by certora*


#### Impact


The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls.


#### Proof of Concept

[[M-03] It is possible to “uninitialize” `ERC20Facet` contract](View%20on%20GitHub)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by Czar102*


#### Impact


The initialization status is defined by the [name and symbol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/ERC20/ERC20Facet.sol#L25-L28). It is possible it set them back to an empty string, uninitializing the contract and letting the `initialize(..)` function be called again. This way, the owner may, for example, hide minting additional tokens. Or, after accidentally setting name and symbol to empty strings, anyone can take control over the contract and mint any number of tokens.


In general, it shouldn’t be possible to initialize more than once.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Consider adding empty string checks in `setName(...)` and `setSymbol(...)` functions.

[[M-04] Annualized fee APY dependence on the frequency of executing a function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/280)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by Czar102*


#### Impact


The APY of the annualized fee is dependent on the frequency of the execution of the [`BasketFacet::chargeOutstandingAnnualizedFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L265-L279). If it is called more frequently, the compounding is more frequent and the APY is higher. For less used baskets, the APY might be lower, because the compounding will happen at lower rate.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Consider [calculating the fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L259-L262) as the compounding was continous or with a constant compounding period.

[[M-05] `totalSupply` may exceed `LibBasketStorage.basketStorage().maxCap`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/283)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by Czar102, also found by gpersoon, gzeon, kenzo, and WatchPug*


#### Impact


Total supply of the token may exceed the `maxCap` introduced. This can happen when a user wants to join the pool. The [check in `BasketFacet::joinPool(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Basket/BasketFacet.sol#L153-L156) includes only the base amount, without fee. Thus, if fee is on and someone will want to create as many tokens as possible, the `totalSupply + _amount` will be set to `maxCap`. The call will succeed, but new tokens were also minted as the fee for `bs.feeBeneficiary` if `bs.entryFee` and `bs.entryFeeBeneficiaryShare` are nonzero. Thus, the number of tokens may exceed `maxCap`.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Consider calculating `feeAmount` and `feeBeneficiaryShare` before the `require(...)` statement and check `totalSupply.add(_amount).add(feeBanficiaryShare) <= this.getCap()`.

[[M-06] block.timestamp or deadline](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/47)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by gpersoon, also found by kenzo and robee*


#### Impact


Some functions, like rebalance() in RebalanceManagerV3 use \_deadline as a time limit for swapExactTokensForTokens()
Other functions, like \_joinTokenSingle() of SingleTokenJoinV2.sol and \_exit() of SingleNativeTokenExitV2() use block.timestamp, although a deadline field is present in the struct.


Possibly the deadline fields should have been used.


#### Proof of Concept


[`RebalanceManagerV3.sol` L158-L203](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/cf890dedf2e43ec787e8e5df65726316fda134a1/contracts/basket/contracts/callManagers/RebalanceManagerV3.sol#L158-L203)

 ..
 \_swapUniswapV2(swap.exchange,input,0, swap.path,address(basket), \_deadline );
```

[`RebalanceManagerV3.sol` L63-L104](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/cf890dedf2e43ec787e8e5df65726316fda134a1/contracts/basket/contracts/callManagers/RebalanceManagerV3.sol#L63-L104)



```
function \_swapUniswapV2(...) {

```
struct JoinTokenStructV2 {
 ...
 uint256 deadline;
 ...
 }
function \_joinTokenSingle(JoinTokenStructV2 calldata \_joinTokenStruct) internal {
 ...
 for (uint256 j; j < trade.swaps.length; j++) {
 IPangolinRouter(swap.exchange).swapExactTokensForTokens( amountIn, 0, swap.path, address(this), block.timestamp );
 }
 }
```

[`SingleNativeTokenExitV2.sol` L59-L88](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/cf890dedf2e43ec787e8e5df65726316fda134a1/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleNativeTokenExitV2.sol#L59-L88)



```

 ...
 for (uint256 j; j < trade.swaps.length; j++) {
 ...
 IPangolinRouter(swap.exchange).swapExactTokensForTokens( IERC20(swap.path[0]).balanceOf(address(this)), 0, swap.path, address(this), block.timestamp );
 }
 }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Check whether the deadline fields should have been used. If so replace block.timestamp with the appropriate deadline

[[M-07] ERC20 return values not checked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/192)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by cmichel, also found by defsec, JMukesh, p4st13r4, and WatchPug*


The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.
Some tokens do **not** revert if the transfer failed but return `false` instead.


See:


* `SingleNativeTokenExitV2.exit`’s `outputToken.transfer(msg.sender, outputTokenBalance);`
* `PieFactoryContract.bakePie`’s `pie.transfer(msg.sender, _initialSupply);`


#### Impact


Tokens that don’t actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer and the tokens remain in the `SingleNativeTokenExitV2` contract and could potentially be stolen by someone else.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


We recommend using [OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

[[M-08] SingleNativeTokenExitV2 assumes first exchange holds the outputToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/176)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by kenzo, also found by cmichel and hyh*


SingleNativeTokenExitV2 allows the user to exit and execute trades via multiple exchanges.
When finishing the trades and sending a single output token back to the user,
the contract takes that token from the last swap in the first exchange’s trades.
There is nothing in the struct that signifies this will be the output token, and this also impairs the exit functionality.


#### Impact


Let’s say a basket only holds token TOKE, and user would like to exit to DAI.
But there’s no exchange with good liquidity for TOKE -> DAI.
So the user crafts a trade to exchange TOKE for WOKE in exchange A, and then exchange WOKE for DAI in exchange B, to finally receive back DAI. The contract will not let him do so, as the output token is taken to be the output token of the first exchange - WOKE in our example.


#### Proof of Concept


In `exit`, the output token is taken to be the last token exchanged in the first exchange: [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/main/contracts/basket/contracts/singleJoinExit/SingleNativeTokenExitV2.sol#L92:#L96)



```
address[] calldata path = \_exitTokenStruct
 .trades[0]
 .swaps[\_exitTokenStruct.trades[0].swaps.length - 1]
 .path;
 IERC20 outputToken = IERC20(path[path.length - 1]); //this could be not the target token
```

This manifests the issue I detailed above.


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


Have the outputToken be a parameter supplied in ExitTokenStructV2.

[[M-09] Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/78)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by harleythedog*


#### Impact


The `CallFacet.sol` contract has the function `_call` :



```
function \_call(
 address \_target,
 bytes memory \_calldata,
 uint256 \_value
) internal {
 require(address(this).balance >= \_value, "ETH\_BALANCE\_TOO\_LOW");
 (bool success, ) = \_target.call{value: \_value}(\_calldata);
 require(success, "CALL\_FAILED");
 emit Call(msg.sender, \_target, \_calldata, \_value);
}
```

This function is utilized in a lot of different places. According to the [Solidity docs](%5Bhttps://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions%5D(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)), “The low-level functions `call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return `true` as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed”.


As a result, it is possible that this call will not work but `_call` will not notice anything went wrong. It could be possible that a user is interacting with an exchange or token that has been deleted, but `_call` will not notice that something has gone wrong and as a result, ether can become stuck in the contract. For this reason, it would be better to also check for the contract’s existence prior to executing `_target.call`.


For reference, see a similar high severity reported in a Uniswap audit here (report # 9): <https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf>


#### Proof of Concept


See `_call` here: [`CallFacet.sol` L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun/blob/98f6e2ff91f5fcebc0489f5871183566feaec307/contracts/basket/contracts/facets/Call/CallFacet.sol#L108).


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps


To ensure tokens don’t get stuck in edge case where user is interacting with a deleted contract, make sure to check that contract actually exists before calling it.

[[M-10] fees calculations are not accurate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-amun-findings/issues/73)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Submitted by certora*


after that fee is calculated, it is minted to the feeBeneficiary.
simply minting the exact amount results lower fee than it should be.


#### Impact


feeBeneficiary will get less fees than it should.


#### Proof of Concept


let’s assume that the basket assets are worth 1M dollars, and totalSupply = 1M.
the result of `calcOutStandingAnnualizedFee` is 100,00 so the feeBeneficiary should get 100,00 dollars.
however, when minting 100,00 the totalSupply will increase to 1,100,000 so they will own 100000/1100000 \* (1M dollars) = 90909.09 dollars instead of 100k
