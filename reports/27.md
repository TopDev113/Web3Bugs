# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Gravity Bridge smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between August 26—September 8 2021.

# High Risk Findings (4)

## [[H-01] Cannot actually submit evidence](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/64)
_Submitted by jmak_

### Impact
The `SubmitBadSignatureEvidence` is not actually registered in the handler and hence no one can actually submit this message, rendering the message useless. This harms the security model of Gravity since validators have no disincentive to attempt to collude and take over the bridge.

### Proof of Concept
The `SubmitBadSignatureEvidence` handler is omitted from `module`/`x`/`gravity`/`handler.go`

### Tools Used
Visual inspection

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Handle the `MsgSubmitBadSignatureEvidence` in `module`/`x`/`gravity`/`handler.go`

## [[H-02] Freeze Bridge via Non-UTF8 Token Name/Symbol/Denom](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by nascent_

Manual insertion of non-utf8 characters in a token name will break parsing of logs and will always result in the oracle getting in a loop of failing and early returning an error. The fix is non-trivial and likely requires significant redesign.

### Proof of Concept
Note the `c0` in the last argument of the call data (invalid UTF8).

It can be triggered with:

```solidity
data memory bytes = hex"f7955637000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000461746f6d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000046e616d6500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000673796d626fc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
gravity.call(data);
```

The log output is as follows:
```solidity
    ERC20DeployedEvent("atom", "name", ❮utf8 decode failed❯: 0x73796d626fc0, 18, 2)
```

Which hits [this code path](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/gravity_utils/src/types/ethereum_events.rs#L431-L438):

```rust
    let symbol = String::from_utf8(input.data[index_start..index_end].to_vec());
    trace!("Symbol {:?}", symbol);
    if symbol.is_err() {
        return Err(GravityError::InvalidEventLogError(format!(
            "{:?} is not valid utf8, probably incorrect parsing",
            symbol
        )));
    }
```

And would cause an early return [here](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/orchestrator/src/ethereum_event_watcher.rs#L99):

```rust
let erc20_deploys = Erc20DeployedEvent::from_logs(&deploys)?;
```

Never updating last checked block and therefore, this will freeze the bridge by disallowing any attestations to take place. This is an extremely low cost way to bring down the network.

#### Recommendation
This is a hard one. Re-syncing is permanently borked because, on the Go side, there is seemingly no way to ever process the event nonce because protobufs do not handle non-utf8 strings. The validator would report they need event nonce `N` from the orchestrator, but they can never parse the event `N`. Seemingly, validators & orchestrators would have to know to ignore that specific event nonce. But it is a permissionless function, so it can be used to effectively permanently stop attestations & the bridge until a new `Gravity.sol` is deployed.

One potential fix is to check in the solidity contract if the name contains valid utf8 strings for denom, symbol and name. This likely will be expensive though. Alternatively, you could require that validators sign ERC20 creation requests and perform checks before the transaction is sent.

## [[H-03] Freeze The Bridge Via Large ERC20 Names/Symbols/Denoms](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/5)
_Submitted by nascent_

Ethereum Oracles watch for events on the `Gravity.sol` contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This is performed in the [`check_for_events`](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/orchestrator/src/ethereum_event_watcher.rs#L23) function, and run in the [`eth_oracle_main_loop`](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/orchestrator/src/main_loop.rs#L94).

In this function, there is [the following code snippet](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/orchestrator/src/ethereum_event_watcher.rs#L66-L73):

```rust
let erc20_deployed = web3
    .check_for_events(
        starting_block.clone(),
        Some(latest_block.clone()),
        vec![gravity_contract_address],
        vec![ERC20_DEPLOYED_EVENT_SIG],
    )
    .await;
```

This snippet leverages the `web30` library to check for events from the `starting_block` to the `latest_block`. Inside the `web30` library this nets out to calling:

```rust
pub async fn eth_get_logs(&self, new_filter: NewFilter) -> Result<Vec<Log>, Web3Error> {
    self.jsonrpc_client
        .request_method(
            "eth_getLogs",
            vec![new_filter],
            self.timeout,
            Some(10_000_000),
        )
        .await
}
```

The `10_000_000` specifies the maximum size of the return in bytes and returns an error if the return is larger:

```rust
let res: Response<R> = match res.json().limit(limit).await {
    Ok(val) => val,
    Err(e) => return Err(Web3Error::BadResponse(format!("Web3 Error {}", e))),
};
```

This can be triggered at will and keep the loop in a perpetual state of returning the `GravityError::EthereumRestError(Web3Error::BadResponse(
            "Failed to get logs!".to_string()))` error. To force the node into this state, you just have to deploy ERC20s generated by the [public function in `Gravity.sol`](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L546-L565):

```solidity
function deployERC20(
    string memory _cosmosDenom,
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals
) public {
    // Deploy an ERC20 with entire supply granted to Gravity.sol
    CosmosERC20 erc20 = new CosmosERC20(address(this), _name, _symbol, _decimals);

    // Fire an event to let the Cosmos module know
    state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);
    emit ERC20DeployedEvent(
        _cosmosDenom,
        address(erc20),
        _name,
        _symbol,
        _decimals,
        state_lastEventNonce
    );
}
```

And specify a large string as the denom, name, or symbol.

If an attacker uses the denom as the attack vector, they save significant gas costing just 256 per additional 32 bytes. For other cases, to avoid gas overhead, you can have the string be mostly 0s resulting in just 584 gas per additional 32 bytes. This leaves it feasible to surpass the 10mb response data in the 6 block buffer. This would throw every ethereum oracle into a state of perpetual errors and all would fall out of sync with the ethereum blockchain. This would result in the batches, logic calls, deposits, ERC20 creations, and `valset` updates to never receive attestations from other validators because their ethereum oracles would be down; the bridge would be frozen and remain frozen until the bug is fixed due to `get_last_checked_block`.

This will freeze the bridge by disallowing attestations to take place.

This requires a patch to reenable the bridge.

#### Recommendation
Handle the error more concretely and check if you got a byte limit error. If you did, chunk the search size into 2 and try again. Repeat as necessary, and combine the results.

Additionally, you could require that validators sign ERC20 creation requests.

## [[H-04] Large Validator Sets/Rapid Validator Set Updates May Freeze the Bridge or Relayers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/6)
_Submitted by nascent_

In a similar vein to "Freeze The Bridge Via Large ERC20 Names/Symbols/Denoms", a sufficiently large validator set or sufficiently rapid validator update, could cause both the `eth_oracle_main_loop` and `relayer_main_loop` to fall into a state of perpetual errors. In `find_latest_valset`, [we call](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/orchestrator/relayer/src/find_latest_valset.rs#L33-L40):

```rust
let mut all_valset_events = web3
    .check_for_events(
        end_search.clone(),
        Some(current_block.clone()),
        vec![gravity_contract_address],
        vec![VALSET_UPDATED_EVENT_SIG],
    )
    .await?;
```

Which if the validator set is sufficiently large, or sufficiently rapidly updated, continuoussly return an error if the logs in a 5000 (see: `const BLOCKS_TO_SEARCH: u128 = 5_000u128;`) block range are in excess of 10mb. Cosmos hub says they will be pushing the number of validators up to 300 (currently 125). At 300, each log would produce 19328 bytes of data (4\*32+64\*300). Given this, there must be below 517 updates per 5000 block range otherwise the node will fall out of sync.

This will freeze the bridge by disallowing attestations to take place.

This requires a patch to reenable the bridge.

#### Recommendation

Handle the error more concretely and check if you got a byte limit error. If you did, chunk the search size into 2 and try again. Repeat as necessary, and combine the results.

# Medium Risk Findings (4)

## [[M-01] The function `updateValset` does not have enough sanity checks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/51)
_Submitted by hrkrshnn, also found by pauliax and shw_

In the [updateValset](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L224) function, the current set of validators adds a new set.

It is missing the check that the combined power of all new validators is above the `state_powerThreshold`. If this is false, then the contract is effectively stuck. Consider adding an on-chain check for this.

It is also worth adding a that the size of the new validator check is less than a certain number.

Here is a rough calculation explaining how 10000 validators (an extreme example) is too much:

1.  Let us say that the new set of validators have the property that at least, say, `N` validators are needed to get the total threshold above `state_powerThreshold`.
2.  Since each validating signature requires a call to `ecrecover`, costing at least `3000` gas, the minimum gas needed for getting a proposal over `state_powerThreshold` would be `N * 3000`
3.  `N * 3000` cannot be more than the `block.gaslimit` Currently, this puts `N` to be less than `10000`

Another approach to solve the above potential problems is to do the updating as a two step process:

1.  The current set of validators proposes a pending set of validators.
2.  And the pending set of validators need to do the transition to become the new set of validators. Going through the same threshold checks.

This guarantees that the new set of validators has enough power to pass threshold and doesn't have gas limit issues in doing so.

## [[M-02] Crash Eth Oracle On Any `LogicCallEvent`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/11)
_Submitted by nascent_

Likelihood: high

In `eth_oracle_main_loop`, `get_last_checked_block` is called. Followed by:

```rust
let logic_call_executed_events = web3
    .check_for_events(
        end_search.clone(),
        Some(current_block.clone()),
        vec![gravity_contract_address],
        vec![LOGIC_CALL_EVENT_SIG],
    )
    .await;
```

and may hit the code path:

```rust
for event in logic_call_executed_events {
    match LogicCallExecutedEvent::from_log(&event) {
        Ok(call) => {
            trace!(
                "{} LogicCall event nonce {} last event nonce",
                call.event_nonce,
                last_event_nonce
            );
            if upcast(call.event_nonce) == last_event_nonce && event.block_number.is_some()
            {
                return event.block_number.unwrap();
            }
        }
        Err(e) => error!("Got ERC20Deployed event that we can't parse {}", e),
    }
}
```

But will panic at `from_log` here:

```rust
impl LogicCallExecutedEvent {
    pub fn from_log(_input: &Log) -> Result<LogicCallExecutedEvent, GravityError> {
        unimplemented!()
    }
    // snip...
}
```

It can/will also be triggered here in `check_for_events`:

```rust
let logic_calls = LogicCallExecutedEvent::from_logs(&logic_calls)?;
```

Attestations will be frozen until patched.

#### Recommendation
Implement the method.

## [[M-03] Win all relayer rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by nascent_

"Large Validator Sets/Rapid Validator Set Updates May Freeze the Bridge or Relayer" can affect just the relayers & not affect the oracle in certain circumstances. This could result in valid attestations, but prevent any of the other relayers from being able to participate in the execution. While the other relayers are down from the other attack, the attacker can win all batch, logic, and valset rewards as their node is the only relayer running. This is possible because `find_latest_valset` is run in the main relayer loop and everytime tries for 5000 blocks of logs.

## [[M-04] Incorrect accounting on transfer-on-fee/deflationary tokens in `Gravity`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/62)
_Submitted by shw_

#### Impact
The `sendToCosmos` function of `Gravity` transfers `_amount` of `_tokenContract` from the sender using the function `transferFrom`. If the transferred token is a transfer-on-fee/deflationary token, the actually received amount could be less than `_amount`. However, since `_amount` is passed as a parameter of the `SendToCosmosEvent` event, the Cosmos side will think more tokens are locked on the Ethereum side.

#### Proof of Concept
Referenced code:
* [Gravity.sol#L535](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L535)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider getting the received amount by calculating the difference of token balance (using `balanceOf`) before and after the `transferFrom`.

# Low Risk Findings (10)
## [[L-01] Direct usage of `ecrecover` allows signature malleability](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by shw, also found by 0xito, JMukesh and pauliax_

#### Impact
The `verifySig` function of `Gravity` calls the Solidity `ecrecover` function directly to verify the given signatures. However, the `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows malleable (non-unique) signatures and thus is susceptible to replay attacks.

Although a replay attack seems not possible here since the nonce is increased each time, ensuring the signatures are not malleable is considered a best practice (and so is checking `_signer != address(0)`, where `address(0)` means an invalid signature).

#### Proof of Concept

Referenced code:
[Gravity.sol#L153](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L153)

[SWC-121: Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use the `recover` function from [OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol) for signature verification.

## [[L-02] Why nonces are not incrementing by 1 ?](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/32)
_Submitted by pauliax, also found by 0xito_

#### Impact
I am concerned why `invalidationId`, `invalidationNonce` or `valsetNonce` are only required to be greater than the previous value. Why did you choose this approach instead of just simply asking for an incremented value? While this may not be a problem if the validators are honest, but otherwise, they may submit a nonce of MAX UINT and thus block the whole system as it would be no longer possible to submit a greater value. Again, just wanted you to be aware of this issue, not sure how likely this to happen is in practice, it depends on the honesty of validators so you better know.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I didn't receive an answer on Discord so decided to submit this FYI to decide if that's a hazard or no.

 > This is frankly a good point. We need to be able to skip nonces because we may sometimes create batches that are not profitable or validator sets that we don't want to bother submitting.
>
> A reasonable mitigation for this issue would be to limit how far ahead we can skip at any one time. Preventing error or hostile action from locking funds in the bridge forever by setting the maximum nonce.

> Still, I think this attack is quite hard to trigger naturally since the nonce is incremented by 1 on the module side and as sending 2^64 -1 transactions on a Cosmos chain (to trigger this overflow) would be cost prohibitive/

## [[L-03] logic calls can steal tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/25)
_Submitted by 0xito, also found by ElliotFriedman_

#### Impact
Attacker can send a logic call that performs a `token.approve(attackerAddress, type(uint256).max)` using the `submitLogicCall` function.

Afterwards, they can steal all tokens from the bridge using `token.safetransferfrom(bridge, attacker, amount)`.

#### Proof of Concept
*   `submitLogicCall` with `token.approve(attackerAddress, type(uint256).max)`
*   call `token.safetransferfrom(bridge, attacker, amount)`

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Disallow calls to the bridge contract, or to any token/NFT contracts that the bridge owns tokens of (`token.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0`).

**[jkilpatr (Althea) disputed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/25#issuecomment-916986886):**
 > I would classify this as low risk at most. Arbitrary logic calls can only be triggered by the Cosmos module itself with full consensus, the ability of arbitrary logic to do unknown dangerous things is the design intent and any call actually deployed would have to have the upmost inspection before being used.

## [[L-04] Large `ValSets` potentially freezes `Gravity.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/9)
_Submitted by nascent, also found by hack3r-0m, and pauliax_

Gas requirements of `makeCheckpoint`: If the size of the validator set grows large enough during a time of block-size expansion, it may be possible to make the validator set large enough that, when the block size shrinks, the gas required to perform `makeCheckpoint` may be larger than the amount of gas available in the block. In that case, the validator set could not be updated until the block size increased. If a reduction in upper gas limit for blocks occurs at the miner layer, it may be bricked permanently.

## [[L-05] ERC20s that block transfer to particular addresses enable DoS/Censorship](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by nascent_

Tokens that prevent transfers to particular addresses (most commonly `address(0)` as is the [OpenZeppelin standard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/aefcb3e8aa4ee8da8e2b7022ffe4dcb57fbb0fdf/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L226)) enables DoS against a batch. If the attacker submits the bad transaction, the relayer wont submit the batch. The attacker never has to worry about the transaction being submitted and paying the fee because the transaction will fail, leaving the relayer stuck with the bill. This can enable MEV between chains by disabling others' ability to close arbitrage between chains by denying them their transfers off the chain.

**[jkilpatr (Althea) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/8#issuecomment-917142410):**
 > The relayer will not actually pay the bill, since we simulate the tx before submission. That being said this is a valid way to block a batch for long enough that it times out.
>
> I would describe this as low risk. Since it doesn't compromise the bridge or lose tokens, just potential value from arbitrage.
>
> The correct solution here is to block invalid transactions from being added to batches on the Cosmos side. (which I just checked we do not block the zero address in MsgSendToEth)

## [[L-06] Downcasting Can Freeze The Chain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/19)
_Submitted by nascent_

The function `utils::downcast_uint256() -> Option<u64>` returns `None` if the input value is greater than `U64MAX`.  If the value being downcast is read from a contract (e.g. a nonce), and the contract could be put into such a state where a `Uint256` is set to higher value, this will cause all nodes to halt execution upon reading this value, requiring a patch to reenable the bridge.

#### Recommendation

Change the signature of `downcast_uint256()` to return a `Result<>`, and/or remove any `unwrap()`s of the result.

**[jkilpatr (Althea) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/19#issuecomment-917029350):**
 > This is valid, dealing with nonces as big-ints is something of a pain and it's reasonable to not expect these values to go over u64 max. I believe with nonce increase limitations as described in #32 this can be mitigated.

**[albertchon (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/19#issuecomment-925863611):**

## [[L-07] Validations of parameters](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by pauliax_

#### Impact
There are a few validations that could be added to the system:
the constructor could check that `_gravityId` is not empty. `state_powerThreshold` should always be greater than 0, otherwise, anyone will be available to execute actions.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider implementing suggested validations.

**[jkilpatr (Althea) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-916965952):**
 > These are good suggestions. In my opinion powerThreshold should probably just be hard coded at this point. GravityID being empty is not a vulnerability I had considered before.

## [[L-08] SafeMath library is not always used in `Gravity`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/60)
_Submitted by shw, also found by pauliax_

#### Impact
SafeMath library functions are not always used in the `Gravity` contract's arithmetic operations, which could cause integer underflow/overflows. Using SafeMath is considered a best practice that could completely prevent underflow/overflows and increase code consistency.

#### Proof of Concept
Referenced code:
* [Gravity.sol#L202](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L202)
* [Gravity.sol#L586](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/92d0e12cea813305e6472851beeb80bd2eaf858d/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L586)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider using the SafeMath library functions in the referenced lines of code.

**[jkilpatr (Althea) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/60#issuecomment-916204081):**
 > An overflow in the powers would be a significant bug, while it would require some pretty dramatic issues no the go module side there is value in checking in. I agree with the severity

## [[L-09] Possible miner incentive for chain reorgs if `ETHBlockDelay` is too small](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/12)

#### Impact
If `ETHBlockDelay` is too small and the incentive for miners is large enough, it would be profitable for miners to attempt
to double spend by depositing assets, waiting for confirmation on the cosmos-SDK and then reorging the blockchain.

Although an attack like this has never been done, it could potentially cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. With MEV at all time highs and miners regularly using custom geth implementations its not totally out of the question to see an attack similar to this happening soon.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The best way to avoid something like this is to make sure to wait for a large number of blocks until a transaction is confirmed by the cosmos system.

**[jkilpatr (Althea) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/12#issuecomment-917136129):**
 > We currently wait 6 blocks, as noted [here](https://github.com/althea-net/cosmos-gravity-bridge/blob/main/orchestrator/orchestrator/src/ethereum_event_watcher.rs#L222) I've done some math on the subject. A 7 block deep reorg would actually halt the bridge so they could only pull this off once.
>
> I do agree it's a moderate risk, but computing how probable (and therefore risky) this sort of attack is requires info that's pretty hard to get.

**[albertchon (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/12#issuecomment-925879648):**
 > We did some investigation into this and concluded that 6 blocks was safe enough

## [[L-10] `cumulativePower` check should be inclusive](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by pauliax_

#### Impact
Based on my understanding `cumulativePower` checks should be inclusive to indicate when the threshold is met. Otherwise, there might be impossible to reach it in certain cases (e.g. when 100% power is required). Replace `>` with `>=` in constructor and function `checkValidatorSignatures`:

```solidity
if (cumulativePower > \_powerThreshold) {
    break;
}
require(
    cumulativePower > \_powerThreshold,
    "Submitted validator set signatures do not have enough power."
);
```
#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
`cumulativePower >= \_powerThreshold`

**[jkilpatr (Althea) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-gravitybridge-findings/issues/26#issuecomment-916985214):**
 > I would classify this as low risk since the bridge would never in any sane situation be configured to require 100% of the power. It's a valid report in the context that a slightly more permissive check could save the day in very specific situations.
