# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis o the Visor Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between May 12 — May 19, 2021.

## Wardens

12 Wardens contributed reports to the Visor Finance code contest:

Final report assembled by [ninek](https://twitter.com/_ninek_) and [moneylegobatman](https://twitter.com/money_lego).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 30 unique vulnerabilities. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 8 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 15 non-critical recommendations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Visor Finance code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance) and is comprised of 24 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings

## [[H-01] A previously timelocked NFT token becomes permanently stuck in vault if it’s ever moved back into the vault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by pauliax_

Let’s consider a scenario where a particular NFT token was timelocked for a certain duration by the owner using `timeLockERC721()` with a delegate as the recipient and then transferred out of the vault by the delegate via `transferERC721()` but without unlocking it explicitly using `timeUnlockERC721()`.

This is possible because `transferERC721()` does all the timelock checks on `expires/block.timestamp` and `recipient/msg.sender` as is done in `timeUnlockERC721()`. But it misses deleting `timelockERC721s[key]` for that NFT `tokenID` (as done in L572 of `timeUnlockERC721()`).

Because of this missing deletion, if that same NFT is ever put back into the vault later but this time without a timelock, the vault logic still thinks it is a timelocked NFT with the older/stale recipient from earlier because of the missing deletion. So now the owner who makes the `transferERC721()` call will not match the older/stale recipient address and will fail the check on L510 (unless they control that stale recipient address from the earlier timelock).

The impact is that, without access/control to the earlier timelock recipient, this NFT token is now locked in the vault forever.

1. Alice time locks a particular NFT token with delegate Eve as recipient using `timeLockERC721()`
2. Eve transfers NFT to Bob using `transferERC721()` but without calling `timeUnlockERC721()` first
3. Alice buys the same NFT back from Bob (e.g. because it is now considered rare and more valuable) and again puts it back in her vault but this time without locking/delegating it to any recipient i.e. intending to control it herself.
4. Because this NFT's timelock data and delegate approval for Eve is never removed after Step 2, the NFT is still treated as timelocked in the vault with previous delegate Eve as the recipient (because of stale data in `timelockERC721s` and `nftApprovals`)
5. Alice now cannot withdraw her own NFT without Eve’s help because the check on L510 will only allow Eve to transfer this NFT out of the vault.
6. If Eve is no longer trusted/accessible then the NFT is locked in the vault forever.

Recommend adding `delete timelockERC721s [timelockERC721Keys[nftContract][i]];` after L510.

## [[H-02] NFT transfer approvals are not removed and cannot be revoked thus leading to loss of NFT tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/34)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by shw_

NFT transfer approvals that are set to true in `approveTransferERC721()` are never set to false and there is no way to remove such an nft approval.

**Impact 1**: The approval is not removed (set to false) after a transfer in `transferERC721()`. So if the NFT is ever moved back into the owner's vault again, then the previous/compromised delegate can again transfer it to any address of choice without requiring a new approval.

**Impact 2**: If a delegate becomes compromised/untrustworthy after granting approval but before transfer then the owner will lose its NFT because there is no mechanism to revoke the approval that was granted earlier.

[PoC-1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance/blob/e0f15162a017130aa66910d46c70ee074b64dd40/contracts/contracts/visor/Visor.sol#L477-L487):
* Alice grants Eve approval to transfer a particular NFT out of its vault using `approveTransferERC721()`
* Eve, who has transfer rights to that NFT from Alice’s vault,  transfers that NFT to Bob using `transferERC721()`
* Alice decides to buy back that NFT (e.g. because it is now considered rare and more valuable) from Bob and transfers it back to its vault
* Eve, who continues to have transfer rights to that NFT from Alice’s vault, can steal that NFT and transfer to anyone

[PoC-2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance/blob/e0f15162a017130aa66910d46c70ee074b64dd40/contracts/contracts/visor/Visor.sol#L489-L522):
* Alice grants Eve approval to transfer a particular NFT out of its vault using `approveTransferERC721()`
* Alice learns that Eve’s keys are compromises or that Eve is malicious and wants to revoke the approval but there is no mechanism to do so
* Eve (or whoever stole her credentials) has transfer rights to that NFT from Alice’s vault and can steal that NFT and transfer to anyone

Recommend adding a boolean parameter to `approveTransferERC721()` and set the `nftApprovals`  to that parameter which can be true for giving approval and false for removing/revoking approval
If ```msg.sender != _getOwner()```, call `approveTransferERC721()` with the boolean false to remove approval before making a transfer in `transferERC721()` on L515.

## [[H-03] Approval for NFT transfers is not removed after transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/48)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by gpersoon, and pauliax_

The `Visor.transferERC721` does not reset the approval for the NFT.

An approved delegatee can move the NFT out of the contract once.
It could be moved to a market and bought by someone else who then deposits it again to the same vault.
The first delegatee can steal the NFT and move it out of the contract a second time.

Recommend resetting the approval on transfer.

## [[H-04] Unbounded loop in `_removeNft` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/80)
_Submitted by shw, also found by cmichel, gpersoon, pauliax, Sherlock, and toastedsteaksandwhich_

Griefing/DOS attack is possible when a malicious NFT contract sends many NFTs to the vault, which could cause excessive gas consumed and even transactions reverted when other users are trying to unlock or transfer NFTs.

The function `_removeNft` uses an unbounded loop, which iterates the array nfts until a specific one is found. If the NFT to be removed is at the very end of the nfts array, this function could consume a large amount of gas.
The function `onERC721Received` is permission-less. The vault accepts any NFTs from any NFT contract and pushes the received NFT into the array nfts.
A malicious user could write an NFT contract, which calls `onERC721Received` of the vault many times to make the array nfts grow to a large size. Besides, the malicious NFT contract reverts when anyone tries to transfer (e.g., `safeTransferFrom`) its NFT.
The vault then has no way to remove the transferred NFT from the malicious NFT contract. The two only functions to remove NFTs, `transferERC721` and `timeUnlockERC721`, fail since the malicious NFT contract reverts all `safeTransferFrom` calls.
As a result, benign users who unlock or transfer NFTs would suffer from large and unnecessary gas consumption. The consumed gas could even exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to fail every time.

Recommend using a mapping (e.g., `mapping(address=>Nft[]) nfts`) to store the received NFTs into separate arrays according to `nftContract` instead of putting them into the same one. Or, add a method specifically for the owner to remove NFTs from the nfts array directly.

# Medium Risk Findings

## [[M-01] Unhandled return value of `transferFrom` in `timeLockERC20()` could lead to fund loss for recipients](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by Sherlock, pauliax, shw, and JMukesh_

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into `require()` statements or use safe wrapper functions implementing return value/data checks to handle these failures. For reference, see similar Medium-severity finding from [Consensys Diligence Audit of Aave Protocol V2](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2/#unhandled-return-values-of-transfer-and-transferfrom).

While the contract uses Uniswap’s `TransferHelper` library function `safeTransfer` in other places for ERC20 tokens, or OpenZeppelin’s `saferTransferFrom` for ERC721 tokens (both of which call the token’s `transfer`/`transferFrom` functions and check return value for success and return data), it misses using `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` in this one case on L610 in `timeLockERC20()` when tokens are transferred from owner to the vault and instead directly uses the token’s `transferFrom()` call without checking for its return value.

The impact can be that for an arbitrary ERC20 token, this `transferFrom()` call may return failure but the vault logic misses that, assumes it was successfully transferred into the vault and updates the `timelockERC20Balances` accounting accordingly. The `timeUnlockERC20()`, `transferERC20()` or `delegatedTransferERC20()` calls for that token will fail because the vault contract balance would have less tokens than accounted for in `timelockERC20Balances` because of the previously failed (but ignored) `transferFrom()` call.

1. Let’s say Alice owes Bob 100 USD after a week, for which they agree that Alice will pay in 100 tokens of USD stablecoin tokenA.
2. Alice, the vault owner, calls `timeLockERC20()` for recipient=Bob, token=tokenA, amount=100 and expiry=1-week-from-then (corresponding Unix timestamp) but tokenA’s implementation does not revert on failure but instead returns true/false. If the `transferFrom` failed, say because Alice did not have those 100 tokenAs, the return value is ignored on L610 in `timeLockERC20()` and vault logic considers that it indeed has 100 tokenAs locked for Bob.
3. Bob looks at the `TimeLockERC20` event emitted in the successful `timeLockERC20()` transaction from Alice and assumes 100 tokenAs are indeed locked by Alice in the vault for him which can be withdrawn after expiry.
4. After timelock expiry, Bob tries to transfer the 100 tokenAs Alice locked in the vault for him. The `TransferHelper`.`safeTransfer()` call on L637 in `timeUnlockERC20()` fails because the vault has 0 tokenAs because they were never successfully transferred in Step 2.
5. Bob could thus be tricked into thinking that 100 tokenAs are locked in the vault for him by Alice but they never were. This leads to loss of funds for Bob.

Recommend replacing use of
```solidity
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
with
```solidity
TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
This will revert on transfer failure for e.g. if `msg.sender` does not have a token balance >= amount.

## [[M-02] `transferERC721` doesn't clean `timelockERC721s`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/19)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by shw_

The function `transferERC721` works similar to the functions `timeUnlockERC721` with timelocked NFT's.
However `timeUnlockERC721` cleans `timelockERC721s` (delete `timelockERC721s[key]`;), while `transferERC721` doesn't clean `timelockERC721s`

This could mean that timelock keys could be used later on (when the NFT would have been transferred to the contract on a later moment in time). Also, the administration doesn't correspond to the available NFT's. Additionally doing a delete gives backs some gas (at least for now).

See [Issue #19](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/19) for code referenced in proof of concept

Recommend checking if the `timelockERC721s` mapping should also be cleaned from `transferERC721`, if so adapt the code accordingly.

# Low Risk Findings

## [[L-01] sandwich `approveTransferERC20`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/10)
_Submitted by pauliax, also found by 0xRajeev, and shw_

Function `approveTransferERC20` is vulnerable to the sandwich attack. Similar to the ERC20 approve issue described [here](https://blog.smartdec.net/erc20-approve-issue-in-simple-words-a41aaf47bca6). A malicious delegate can scout for a `approveTransferERC20` change and sandwich that (`delegatedTransferERC20` amount A, `approveTransferERC20` amount A->B, `delegatedTransferERC20` amount B). It is more of a theoretical issue and mostly depends on the honesty of the delegators. If we can assume that delegators are trustable actors, then this is very unlikely to happen.

Possible mitigation could be to replace `approveTransferERC20` with increasing/decreasing functions.

## [[L-02] Wrong `TimeLockERC20` event emitted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/45)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xRajeev, pauliax_

The `Visor.timeLockERC721` function emits the `TimeLockERC20` event but should emit `TimeLockERC721` instead.

It allows tricking the backend into registering ERC20 token transfers that never happened which could lead to serious issues when something like an accounting app uses this data.

Recommend emitting the correct event.

## [[L-03] Timelock keys are never removed after unlocks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/37)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by shw_

`timelockERC20Keys` and `timelockERC721Keys` are used to keep track of number of timelocks for ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. While `timelockERC20()` and `timelockERC721()` functions update these data structures to add the new timelocks, the corresponding unlock functions do not remove the expired timelocks.

This results in their getter functions `getTimeLockCount()` and `getTimeLockERC721Count()` returning the number of all timelocks ever held instead of the expected number of timelocks that are currently active.

Let’s say 5 timelocks are created for a specific ERC20 token of which 3 have been unlocked after expiry. The getter function `getTimeLockCount()` incorrectly reports 5 instead of 2.

Recommend removing unlocked keys from `timelockERC20Keys` and `timelockERC721Keys` in `timeUnlockERC20()` and `timeUnlockERC721()` functions.

## [[L-04] The function `onERC721Received()` allows writing duplicates in the array "nfts". Another functions dealing with this array do not expect duplicates met.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/67)
_Submitted by Sherlock_

Duplicates can be written accidentally. `If_removeNft()` function is running, it will break when meeting the first match, not trying to remove other duplicates. Thus a caller should call removing a few times.

```solidity
function onERC721Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata) external override returns (bytes4) {
      _addNft(msg.sender, tokenId);

function _addNft(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) internal {
    nfts.push(
    Nft({
        tokenId: tokenId,
        nftContract: nftContract
    })
    );
```

Recommend that `In _addNft()` to check if an inputted nft is existing in the "nfts" array. Do not push inputted nft if already added.

## [[L-05] `delegatedTransferERC20` can revert when called by owner](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/21)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by cmichel and pauliax_

If the function `delegatedTransferERC20` is called from the owner  (e.g. msg.sender == _getOwner ) then
```erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))]``` doesn't have to set, so it can have the value of 0.

If you then subtract the amount, you will get an error and the code will revert:
```solidity
erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))] = erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))].sub(amount);
```

A workaround would be to call `approveTransferERC20` also for the owner.

```solidity
function delegatedTransferERC20(address token,address to,uint256 amount) external {
    if(msg.sender != _getOwner()) {
        require(erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))] >= amount,"Account not approved to transfer amount");
    }
    // check for sufficient balance
    require(IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= (getBalanceLocked(token).add(amount)).add(timelockERC20Balances[token]),"UniversalVault: insufficient balance");

    erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))] = erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))].sub(amount);

    // perform transfer
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, amount);
}
```

Recommend also adding `if(msg.sender != _getOwner())` before
```solidity
   erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))] = erc20Approvals[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, token))].sub(amount);
```

_Submitted by shw_

The functions `timeLockERC20` and `timeUnlockERC20` do not consider deflationary tokens, which burn a percentage of the transferred amount during transfers. In that case, time-locked deflationary ERC20 tokens cannot be unlocked (by `timeUnlockERC20`) nor transferred out of the vault (by `transferERC20`), since the transferred amount exceeds the vault's balance.

Recommend that in function `timeLockERC20`, after the function `transferFrom`, the vault should get the actual received amount by `token.balanceOf(address(this)).sub(tokenAmountBeforeTransfer)`.

## [[G-01] Change function visibility from public to external](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/27)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

Functions `getTimeLockCount()`, `getTimeLockERC721Count()`, `timeLockERC721()`, `timeUnlockERC721()`, `timeLockERC20()` and `timeUnlockERC20()` are never called from within contracts but yet declared public. Their visibility can be made external to save gas.

As described in https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/:
> “For all the public functions, the input parameters are copied to memory automatically, and it costs gas. If your function is only called externally, then you should explicitly mark it as external. External function’s parameters are not copied into memory but are read from `calldata` directly. This small optimization in your solidity code can save you a lot of gas when the function input parameters are huge.”

Recommend changing function visibility from public to external.

## [[G-05] Breaking out of loop can save gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/32)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

In function `transferERC721()`, the for loop iterates over all the time locked keys for the nftContract `timelockERC721Keys[nftContract].length` times. Given that there will only be a maximum of one `tokenID` that will match (because of unique NFT tokenIDs), if any, we can break from iterating the rest of the loop after a match on L505 and the checks within the if body. This will prevent iterating the rest of the loop and trying to match the if condition on L505 after a match has already happened.

Recommend adding a break statement after L510 within the if body.

Using public over external has an impact on execution cost.

If we run the following methods on Remix, we can see the difference
``` solidity
//  transaction cost	21448 gas
//  execution cost	176 gas
function tt() external returns(uint256) {
    return 0;
}

//  transaction cost	21558 gas
//  execution cost	286 gas
function tt_public() public returns(uint256) {
    return 0;
}
```
See [issue page](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/51) for list of methods currently using public that should be declared external.

Recommend just changing from public to external if possible.

## [[G-07] Gas optimization storage NFTs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/52)
_Submitted by a_delamo_

In `Visor.sol`, NFTs are being stored using an array `Nft[] public nfts;`

This seems an optimal structure, but when needing to remove an NFT or look for an NFT by contract and id,
we need to do `O(n)` iterations.

See [issue page](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-visorfinance-findings/issues/52) for referenced code.

Checking the function `getNftById`, seems like a lookup by id (mapping(uint=> NFT)) should be fine.
In case we need more, we could do mapping(uint => mapping(address => NFT)), but doesn't seems necessary.

Recommend providing direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.

_Submitted by pauliax_

`getNftById` is actually 'get NFT by index' as it queries the element from the array by index, not by `tokenId`. The index may not always equal id as` _addNft` does not automatically assign index incrementally but rather use a parameter's value. Same with `getNftIdByTokenIdAndAddr`, it returns index, not token id.

Recommend either renaming functions to distinguish between id and index or refactoring the function to suit its name.

I suggest introducing a max lock time limit, so it won't be possible to accidentally lock tokens forever. As of right now there is no limit on when the timelock expires, so theoretically it is possible to set it to hundreds of years which I think in practice wouldn't make sense.

Even though this is more of a theoretical issue, I recommend introducing a reasonable upper limit for the timelock period.
