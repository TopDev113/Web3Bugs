# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Kuiper contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between September 16—September 22 2021.

_Note: this audit contest originally ran under the name `defiProtocol`._

# High Risk Findings (3)
## [[H-01] Re-entrancy in `settleAuction` allow stealing all funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/223)
_Submitted by cmichel_

Note that the `Basket` contract approved the `Auction` contract with all tokens and the `settleAuction` function allows the auction bonder to transfer all funds out of the basket to themselves.
The only limiting factor is the check afterwards that needs to be abided by. It checks if enough tokens are still in the basket after settlement:

```solidity
// this is the safety check if basket still has all the tokens after removing arbitrary amounts
for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {
    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;
    require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);
}
``` 

The bonder can pass in any `inputTokens`, even malicious ones they created.
This allows them to re-enter the `settleAuction` multiple times for the same auction.

Calling this function at the correct time (such that `bondTimestamp - auctionStart` makes `newRatio < basket.ibRatio()`), the attacker can drain more funds each time, eventually draining the entire basket.

#### Proof Of Concept

Assume that the current `basket.ibRatio` is `1e18` (the initial value).
The basket publisher calls `basket.publishNewIndex` with some tokens and weights.
For simplicity, assume that the pending `tokens` are the same as tokens as before, only the weights are different, i.e., this would just rebalance the portfolio.
The function call then starts the auction.

The important step to note is that the `tokensNeeded` value in `settleAuction` determines how many tokens need to stay in the `basket`.
If we can continuously lower this value, we can keep removing tokens from the `basket` until it is empty.

The `tokensNeeded` variable is computed as `basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE`.
The only variable that changes in the computation when re-entering the function is `newRatio` (no basket tokens are burned, and the pending weights are never cleared).

Thus if we can show that `newRatio` decreases on each re-entrant call, we can move out more and more funds each time.

###### newRatio decreases on each call

After some time, the attacker calls `bondForRebalance`. This determines the `bondTimestamp - auctionStart` value in `settleAuction`.
The attack is possible as soon as `newRatio < basket.ibRatio()`.
For example, using the standard parameters the calculation would be:

```solidity
// a = 2 * ibRatio
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
// b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * 1e14
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
// newRatio = a - b = 2 * ibRatio - (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * 1e14
uint256 newRatio = a - b;
```

With our initial assumption of `ibRatio = 1e18` and calling `bondForRebalance` after 11,000 seconds (\~3 hours) we will get our result that `newRatio` is less than the initial `ibRatio`:

```python
newRatio = a - b = 2 * 1e18 - (11000) * 1e14 = 2e18 - 1.1e18 = 0.9e18 < 1e18 = basket.ibRatio
```

> This seems to be a reasonable value (when the pending tokens and weights are equal in value to the previous ones) as no other bonder would want to call this earlier such when `newRatio > basket.ibRatio` as they would put in more total value in tokens as they can take out of the basket.

###### re-enter on settleAuction

The attacker creates a custom token `attackerToken` that re-enters the `Auction.settleAuction` function on `transferFrom` with parameters we will specify.

They call `settleAuction` with `inputTokens = [attackerToken]` to re-enter several times.

In the inner-most call where `newRatio = 0.9e18`, they choose the `inputTokens`/`outputTokens` parameters in a way to pass the initial `require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);` check - transferring out any other tokens of `basket` with `outputTokens`.

The function will continue to run and call `basket.setNewWeights();` and `basket.updateIBRatio(newRatio);` which will set the new weights (but not clear the pending ones) and set the new `basket.ibRatio`.

Execution then jumps to the 2nd inner call after the `IERC20(inputTokens[i]=attackerToken).safeTransferFrom(...)` and has the chance to transfer out tokens again.
It will compute `newRatio` with the new lowered `basket.ibRatio` of `0.9e18`: `newRatio = a - b = 2 * 0.9e18 - 1.1e18 = 0.7e18`.
Therefore, `tokensNeeded` is lowered as well and the attacker was allowed to transfer out more tokens having carefully chosen `outputWeights`.

This repeats with `newRatio = 0.3`.

The attack is quite complicated and requires carefully precomputing and then setting the parameters, as well as sending back the `bondAmount` tokens to the `auction` contract which are then each time transferred back in the function body.
But I believe this should work.

#### Impact

The basket funds can be stolen.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add re-entrancy checks (for example, OpenZeppelin's "locks") to the `settleAuction` function.

## [[H-02] `Basket.sol#auctionBurn()` A failed auction will freeze part of the funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/134)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L102-L108>

Given the `auctionBurn()` function will `_burn()` the auction bond without updating the `ibRatio`. Once the bond of a failed auction is burned, the proportional underlying tokens won't be able to be withdrawn, in other words, being frozen in the contract.

#### Proof of Concept

With the configuration of:

basket.ibRatio = 1e18
factory.bondPercentDiv = 400
basket.totalSupply = 400
basket.tokens = \[BTC, ETH]
basket.weights = \[1, 1]

1.  Create an auction;
2.  Bond with 1 BASKET TOKEN;
3.  Wait for 24 hrs and call `auctionBurn()`;

`basket.ibRatio` remains to be 1e18; basket.totalSupply = 399.

Burn 1 BASKET TOKEN will only get back 1 BTC and 1 ETH, which means, there are 1 BTC and 1 ETH frozen in the contract.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
function auctionBurn(uint256 amount) onlyAuction external override {
    handleFees();
    uint256 startSupply = totalSupply();
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);

    uint256 newIbRatio = ibRatio * startSupply / (startSupply - amount);
    ibRatio = newIbRatio;

    emit NewIBRatio(newIbRatio);
    emit Burned(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## [[H-03] Reentrancy in settleAuction(): malicious publisher can bypass index timelock mechanism, inject malicious index, and rug the basket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by kenzo, also found by itsmeSTYJ and jonah1005_

The `settleAuction()` function calls `withdrawBounty()` before setting `auctionOngoing = false`, thereby allowing reentrancy.

#### Impact

A malicious publisher can bypass the index timelock mechanism and publish new index which the basket's users won't have time to respond to.
At worst case, this means setting weights that allow the publisher to withdraw all the basket's underlying funds for himself, under the guise of a valid new index.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  The publisher (a contract) will propose new valid index and bond the auction.

    To settle the auction, the publisher will execute the following steps in the same transaction:

2. Add a bounty of an ERC20 contract with a malicious `transfer()` function.

3. Settle the valid new weights correctly (using `settleAuction()` with the correct parameters, and passing the malicious bounty id).

4. `settleAuction()` will call `withdrawBounty()` which upon transfer will call the publisher's malicious ERC20 contract.

5. The contract will call `settleAuction()` again, with empty parameters. Since the previous call's effects have already set all the requirements to be met, `settleAuction()` will finish correctly and call `setNewWeights()` which will set the new valid weights and set `pendingWeights.pending = false`.

6. Still inside the malicious ERC20 contract transfer function, the attacker will now call the basket's `publishNewIndex()`, with weights that will transfer all the funds to him upon his burning of shares. This call will succeed to set new pending weights as the previous step set `pendingWeights.pending = false`.

7. Now the malicious `withdrawBounty()` has ended, and the original `settleAuction()` is resuming, but now with malicious weights in `pendingWeights` (set in step 6). `settleAuction()` will now call `setNewWeights()` which will set the basket's weights to be the malicious pending weights.

8. Now `settleAuction` has finished, and the publisher (within the same transaction) will `burn()` all his shares of the basket, thereby transferring all the tokens to himself.

# Medium Risk Findings (23)
## [[M-01] Use safeTransfer instead of transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/196)
_Submitted by hack3r-0m, also found by itsmeSTYJ, JMukesh, leastwood, and shenwilly_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L146>

`transfer()` might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring return value leads to considering it successful.

use `safeTransfer()` or check the return value if length of returned data is > 0.

**[frank-beard (Kuiper) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/196)**

## [[M-02] Fee on transfer tokens can lead to incorrect approval](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/236)
_Submitted by hrkrshnn, also found by itsmeSTYJ_

#### Fee on transfer tokens can lead to incorrect approval

The
[createBasket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L106)
function does not account for tokens with fee on transfer.

```solidity
function createBasket(uint256 idNumber) external override returns (IBasket) {
    // ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < bProposal.weights.length; i++) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(bProposal.tokens[i]);
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), bProposal.weights[i]);
        token.safeApprove(address(newBasket), bProposal.weights[i]);
    }
    // ...
}
```

The function `safeTransferFrom` may not transfer exactly
`bProposal.weights[i]` amount of tokens, for tokens with a fee on
transfer. This means that the `safeApprove` call in the next line would
be approving more tokens than what was received, leading to accounting
issues.

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to find the balance of the current contract before and
after the `transferFrom` to see how much tokens were received, and
approve only what was received.

## [[M-03] `onlyOwner` Role Can Unintentionally Influence `settleAuction()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/192)
_Submitted by leastwood_

#### Impact

The `onlyOwner` role is able to make changes to the protocol with an immediate affect, while other changes made in `Basket.sol` and `Auction.sol` incur a one day timelock. As a result, an `onlyOwner` role may unintentionally frontrun a `settleAuction()` transaction by making changes to `auctionDecrement` and `auctionMultiplier`, potentially causing the auction bonder to over compensate during a rebalance. Additionally, there is no way for an auction bonder to recover their tokens in the event this does happen.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L39-L59>
- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L99>

#### Tools Used

Manual code review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a timelock delay to all functions affecting protocol execution. Alternatively, `bondForRebalance()` can set state variables for any external calls made to `Factory.sol` (i.e. `factory.auctionMultiplier()` and `factory.auctionDecrement()`), ensuring that `settleAuction()` is called according to these expected results.

## [[M-04] User can mint miniscule amount of shares, later withdraw miniscule more than deposited](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/81)
_Submitted by kenzo_

If a user is minting small amount of shares (like 1 - amount depends on baskets weights), the calculated amount of tokens to pull from the user can be less than 1, and therefore no tokens will be pulled. However the shares would still be minted.
If the user does this a few times, he could then withdraw the total minted shares and end up with more tokens than he started with - although a miniscule amount.

#### Impact

User can end up with more tokens than he started with. However, I didn't find a way for the user to get an amount to make this a feasible attack. He gets dust. However he can still get more than he deserves. If for some reason the basket weights grow in a substantial amount, this could give the user more tokens that he didn't pay for.

#### Proof of Concept

Add the following test to `Basket.test.js`.
The user starts with 5e18 UNI, 1e18 COMP, 1e18 AAVE,
and ends with 5e18+4, 1e18+4, 1e18+4.
```js
it("should give to user more than he deserves", async () => {
    await UNI.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(UNI_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));
    await COMP.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(COMP_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));
    await AAVE.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(AAVE_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));

    await UNI.connect(owner).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(UNI_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));
    await COMP.connect(owner).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(COMP_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));
    await AAVE.connect(owner).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(AAVE_WEIGHT).mul(1000000));

    console.log("User balance before minting:");
    console.log("UNI balance: " + (await UNI.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("COMP balance: " + (await COMP.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("AAVE balance: " + (await AAVE.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());

    
    await basket.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1).div(1));
    await basket.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1).div(1));
    await basket.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1).div(1));
    await basket.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1).div(1));
    await basket.connect(owner).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1).div(1));

    console.log("\nUser balance after minting 1 share 5 times:");
    console.log("UNI balance: " + (await UNI.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("COMP balance: " + (await COMP.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("AAVE balance: " + (await AAVE.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());

    await basket.connect(owner).burn(await basket.balanceOf(owner.address));
    console.log("\nUser balance after burning all shares:");
    console.log("UNI balance: " + (await UNI.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("COMP balance: " + (await COMP.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
    console.log("AAVE balance: " + (await AAVE.balanceOf(owner.address)).toString());
});
```

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to `pullUnderlying`:
```solidity
require(tokenAmount > 0);
```

I think it makes sense that if a user is trying to mint an amount so small that no tokens could be pulled from him, the mint request should be denied.
Per my tests, for an initial ibRatio, this number (the minimal amount of shares that can be minted) is 2 for weights in magnitude of 1e18, and if the weights are eg. smaller by 100, this number will be 101.

A malicious user can listen to the mempool and immediately bond when an auction starts, without aim of settling the auction. As no one can cancel his bond in less than 24h, this will freeze user funds and auction settlement for 24h until his bond is burned and the new index is deleted. The malicious user can then repeat this when a new auction starts.

#### Impact

Denial of service of the auction mechanism. The malicious user can hold the basket "hostage" and postpone or prevent implementing new index.
The only way to mitigate it would be to try to front-run the malicious user, obviously not ideal.

#### Proof of Concept

publishAllIndex:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L170>

*   The attacker would listen to this function / PublishedNewIndex event and upon catching it, immediately bond the auction.
*   The publisher has no way to burn a bond before 24h has passed. But even if he could, it would not really help as the attacker could just bond again (though losing funds in the process).

settleAuction:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L79>

*   Only the bonder can settle.

bondBurn:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L111>

*   Can only burn 24h after bond.

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If we only allow one user to bond, I see no real way to mitigate this attack, because the malicious user could always listen to the mempool and immediately bond when an auction starts and thus lock it.
So we can change to a mechanism that allows many people to bond and only one to settle;
but at that point, I see no point to the bond mechanism any more. So we might as well remove it and let anybody settle the auction.

With the bond mechanism, a potential settler would have 2 options:

*   Bond early: no one else will be able to bond and settle, but the user would need to leave more tokens in the basket (as newRatio starts large and decreases in time)
*   Bond late: the settler might make more money as he will need to leave less tokens in the basket, but he risks that somebody else will bond and settle before him.

Without a bond mechanism, the potential settler would still have these equivalent 2 options:

*   Settle early: take from basket less tokens, but make sure you win the auction
*   Settle late: take from basket more tokens, but risk that somebody settles before you

So that's really equivalent to the bonding scenario.

I might be missing something but at the moment I see no detriment to removing the bonding mechanism.

## [[M-06] Basket becomes unusable if everybody burns their shares](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/64)
_Submitted by kenzo_

While handling the fees, the contract calculates the new `ibRatio` by dividing by `totalSupply`. This can be 0 leading to a division by 0.

#### Impact

If everybody burns their shares, in the next mint, `totalSupply` will be 0, `handleFees` will revert, and so nobody will be able to use the basket anymore.

#### Proof of Concept

Vulnerable line:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L124>
You can add the following test to Basket.test.js and see that it reverts:
```js
it("should divide by 0", async () => {
await basket.connect(addr1).burn(await basket.balanceOf(addr1.address));
await basket.connect(addr2).burn(await basket.balanceOf(addr2.address));

    await UNI.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
    await COMP.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
    await AAVE.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
    await basket.connect(addr1).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
});
```

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to `handleFees`: if `totalSupply= 0`, you can just return, no need to calculate new `ibRatio` / fees.
You might want to reset `ibRatio` to BASE at this point.

## [[M-07] No minimum rate in the auction may break the protocol under network failure](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/42)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact

The aution contract decides a new `ibRatio` in the function `settleAuction`. [Auction.sol#L89-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L91)

```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;
```

There's a chance that `newRatio` would be really close to zero. This imposes too much risk on the protocol. The network may not really be healthy all the time. Solana and Arbitrum were down and Ethereum was suffered a forking issue recently. Also, the network may be jammed from time to time. This could cause huge damage to a protocol. Please refer to [Black Thursday for makerdao 8.32 million was liquidated for 0 dai](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6)

Given the chance that all user may lose their money, I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend setting a minimum `ibRatio` when a publisher publishes a new index. The auction should be killed if the `ibRatio` is too low.

## [[M-08]  settleAuction may be impossible if locked at a wrong time.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/41)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact

The auction contract decides a new `ibRatio` in the function `settleAuction`. [Auction.sol#L89-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L91)

```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;
```

In this equation, `a` would not always be greater than `b`. The `  auctionBonder ` may lock the token in `bondForRebalance()` at a point that `a-b` would always revert.

The contract should not allow users to lock the token at the point that not gonna succeed. Given the possible (huge) loss of the user may suffer, I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

Here's a web3.py script to trigger this bug.

```python
basket.functions.publishNewIndex([dai.address], [deposit_amount]).transact()

for i in range(4 * 60 * 24):
    w3.provider.make_request('evm_mine', [])
basket.functions.publishNewIndex([dai.address], [deposit_amount]).transact()

print('auction on going', auction.functions.auctionOngoing().call())
for i in range(20000):
    w3.provider.make_request('evm_mine', [])

all_token = basket.functions.balanceOf(user).call()
basket.functions.approve(auction.address, all_token).transact()
auction.functions.bondForRebalance().transact()
# error Log
# {'code': -32603, 'message': 'Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)'}
auction.functions.settleAuction([], [], [], [], []).transact()
```

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend to calculate the new irate in `bondForRebalance`. I understand the `auctionBonder` should take the risk to get the profit. However, the contract should protect the user in the first place when this auction is doomed to fail.

## [[M-09] Fee calculation is potentially incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/129)
_Submitted by itsmeSTYJ_

#### Impact

More fees are actually charged than intended

#### Mitigation Steps

[Basket.sol line 118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L118)

Assume that license fee is 10% i.e. 1e17 and time diff = half a year.

When you calculate `feePct`, you expect to get 5e16 since that's 5% and the actual amount of fee to be charged should be totalSupply \* feePct (5) / BASE (100) but on line 118, we are actually dividing by BASE - feePct i.e. 95.

5 / 95 = 0.052 instead of the intended 0.05.

Solution is to replace `BASE - feePct` in the denominator with `BASE`.

## [[M-10] `burn` and `mintTo` in `Basket.sol` vulnerable to reentrancy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/248)

#### Impact

The functions [mintTo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L82)

#### Proof of Concept

An attacker could reenter the `mintTo` function when the contract pulls an ERC777 token from the user and mint more tokens than they deposited.

#### Tools Used

Slither

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Move external calls after state updates. It is best practice to make external calls after updating state in accordance with the check-effect-interact pattern.

## [[M-11] Owner can steal all Basket funds during auction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/265)
_Submitted by 0xsanson_

#### Impact

The owner of Factory contract can modify the values of `auctionMultiplier` and `auctionDecrement` at any time.
During an auction, these values are used to calculate `newRatio` and thereby `tokensNeeded`: specifically, it's easy to set the factory parameters so that `tokensNeeded = 0` (or close to zero) for every token.
This way the owner can participate at an auction, change the parameters, and get the underlying tokens from a Basket without transferring any pending tokens.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89-L99>

#### Tools Used

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-12] Factory.sol - lack of checks in `setAuctionDecrement` will cause reverts in Auction::settleAuction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/119)
_Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by goatbug_

#### Impact

`setAuctionDecrement` doesn't check for a min nor a max amount
This means we can change `auctionDecrement` which would allow `owner` to set `auctionDecrement` to 0

This will cause the function `settleAuction` in Auction.sol to revert

This allows the owner to block auctions from being settled

#### Proof of Concept

`setAuctionDecrement(0)`
Now `settleAuction` will revert due to division by 0

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checks in `setAuctionDecrement`
Refactor to

## [[M-14] `Basket.sol#handleFees()` could potentially cause disruption of minting and burning](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/79)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L110-L129>

```solidity
function handleFees() private {
    if (lastFee == 0) {
        lastFee = block.timestamp;
    } else {
        uint256 startSupply = totalSupply();

        uint256 timeDiff = (block.timestamp - lastFee);
        uint256 feePct = timeDiff * licenseFee / ONE_YEAR;
        uint256 fee = startSupply * feePct / (BASE - feePct);

```

`timeDiff * licenseFee` can be greater than `ONE_YEAR` when `timeDiff` and/or `licenseFee` is large enough, which makes `feePct` to be greater than `BASE` so that `BASE - feePct` will revert on underflow.

#### Impact

Minting and burning of the basket token are being disrupted until the publisher update the `licenseFee`.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Create a basket with a `licenseFee` of `1e19` or 1000% per year and mint 1 basket token;
2.  The basket remain inactive (not being minted or burned) for 2 months;
3.  Calling `mint` and `burn` reverts at `handleFees()`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Limit the max value of `feePct`.

## [[M-15] `Auction.sol#settleAuction()` late auction bond could potentially not being able to be settled, cause funds loss to bonder](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/90)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

The `newRatio` that determines `tokensNeeded` to settle the auction is calculated based on `auctionMultiplier`, `bondTimestamp - auctionStart` and `auctionDecrement`.

```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;
```

However, if an auction is bonded late (`bondTimestamp - auctionStart` is a large number), and/or the `auctionMultiplier` is small enough, and/or the `auctionDecrement` is small enough, that makes `b` to be greater than `a`, so that `uint256 newRatio = a - b;` will revert on underflow.

This might seem to be an edge case issue, but considering that a rebalance auction of a bag of shitcoin to high-value tokens might just end up being bonded at the last minute, with a `newRatio` near zero. When we take the time between the bonder submits the transaction and it got packed into a block, it's quite possible that the final `bondTimestamp` gets large enough to revet `a - b`.

##### Impact

An auction successfully bonded by a regular user won't be able to be settled, and the user will lose the bond.

##### Proof of Concept

With the configuration of:

basket.ibRatio = 1e18
factory.auctionDecrement = 5760 (Blocks per day)
factory.auctionMultiplier = 2

1.  Create an auction;
2.  The auction remain inactive (not get bonded) for more than 2 days (>11,520 blocks);
3.  Call `bondForRebalance()` and it will succeed;
4.  Calling `settleAuction()` will always revert.

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Calculate and require `newRatio > 0` in `bondForRebalance()`, or limit the max value of decrement and make sure newRatio always > 0 in `settleAuction()`.

        Bounty memory bounty = _bounties[bountyIds[i]];
        require(bounty.active);

        IERC20(bounty.token).transfer(msg.sender, bounty.amount);
        bounty.active = false;

        emit BountyClaimed(msg.sender, bounty.token, bounty.amount, bountyIds[i]);
    }
}
```

In the `withdrawBounty` function, `bounty.active` should be set to `false` when the bounty is claimed.

However, since `bounty` is stored in memory, the state update will not succeed.

##### Impact

An auction successfully bonded by a regular user won't be able to be settled if they passed seemly active bountyIds, and the bonder will lose the bond.

##### Proof of Concept

1.  Create an auction;
2.  Add a bounty;
3.  Auction settled with bounty claimed;
4.  Create a new auction;
5.  Add a new bounty;
6.  Calling `settleAuction()` with the bountyIds of the 2 seemly active bounties always reverts.

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
Bounty storage bounty = _bounties[bountyIds[i]];
```

## [[M-17] Unsafe approve would halt the auction and burn the bond](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by 0xRajeev, 0xsanson, cmichel, and itsmeSTYJ_

#### Impact

[Basket.sol#L224-L228](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L224-L228) calls approve that do not handle non-standard erc20 behavior.

1.  Some token contracts do not return any value.
2.  Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.

Since the auction contract calls `setNewWeights` in function `settleAuction`, `auctionBonder` may lock its bond and never successfully settles the auction. This leads to the `auctionBonder` loss he's bond and the basket and the auction becomes suspended.

`auctionBonder` would lose his bond and the contract would be suspended. I consider this a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept

USDT may be a classic non-standard erc20 token.

Here's a short POC.

```python
usdt.functions.approve(basket.address, 100).transact()
## the second tx would be reverted as the allowance is not zero
usdt.functions.approve(basket.address, 50).transact()
```

#### Tools Used

None

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend to use `safeApprove` instead and set the allowance to 0 before calling it.

```solidity
function approveUnderlying(address spender) private {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeApprove(spender, 0);
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeApprove(spender, type(uint256).max);
    }
}
```

## [[M-18] licenseFee can be greater than BASE](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/104)
_Submitted by itsmeSTYJ_

#### Impact

Worst case - no functions that contains `handleFees()` can pass because [line 118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L118) will always underflow and revert. You only need `feePct` to be bigger than `BASE` for the `handleFees()` function to fail which will result in a lot of gas wasted and potentially bond burnt.

I did not classify this as high risk because a simple fix would be to simply reduce the licenseFee via `changeLicenseFee`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add these require statement to the following functions:

*   Basket.changeLicenseFee()
    *   `require(newLicenseFee <= BASE, "changeLicenseFee: license fee cannot be greater than 100%");`
*   Factory.proposeBasketLicense()
    *   `require(licenseFee <= BASE, "proposeBasketLicense: license fee cannot be greater than 100%");`

## [[M-19] Scoop ERC20 tokens from basket contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/56)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact

Suppose some unrelated ERC20 tokens end up in the basket contract  (via an airdrop, a user mistake etc)

Then anyone can do a `bondForRebalance()` and `settleAuction()` to scoop these tokens.

The function `settleAuction()` allows you to specify an outputToken, so also completely unrelated tokens.
Thus you can retrieve additional tokens with  `settleAuction()`

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L69>
function settleAuction(..  address\[] memory outputTokens, uint256\[] memory outputWeights) public override {
...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < outputTokens.length; i++) {
IERC20(outputTokens\[i]).safeTransferFrom(address(basket), msg.sender, outputWeights\[i]);
}

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check outputTokens are part of the previous basket tokens  (e.g. `basket.tokens()` )

## [[M-20] Auction multiplier set to zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/242)
_Submitted by goatbug_

#### Impact
```solidity
function setAuctionMultiplier(uint256 newAuctionMultiplier) public override onlyOwner {
    auctionMultiplier = newAuctionMultiplier;
}
```

auction multiplier can be set to zero by factory owner. This would stop the auction settling, function would always revert.
```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
    uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
    uint256 newRatio = a - b;
```

causing a safe math error and `newRatio` to revert.

#### Proof of Concept

## [[M-21] Zero weighted baskets are allowed to steal funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/21)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

#### Impact

It was observed that Publisher is allowed to create a basket with zero token and weight. This can lead to user fund stealing as described in below poc
The issue was discovered in `validateWeights` function of Basket contract

#### Proof of Concept

1.  User proposes a new Basket with 0 tokens and weights using `proposeBasketLicense` function in Factory contract

```solidity
Proposal memory proposal = Proposal({
        licenseFee: 10,
        tokenName: abc,
        tokenSymbol: aa,
        proposer: 0xabc,
        tokens: {},
        weights: {},
        basket: address(0)
});
```

2.  `validateWeights` function is called and it returns success as the only check performed is `\_tokens.length == \_weights.length (0=0)`

```solidity
function validateWeights(address[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _weights) public override pure {
    require(_tokens.length == _weights.length);
    uint256 length = _tokens.length;
    address[] memory tokenList = new address[](length);

    // check uniqueness of tokens and not token(0)

    for (uint i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        ...
    }
}
```

3.  A new proposal gets created
```solidity
   _proposals.push(proposal);
```

4.  User creates new Basket with this proposal using `createBasket` function

```solidity
function createBasket(uint256 idNumber) external override returns (IBasket) {
    Proposal memory bProposal = _proposals[idNumber];
    require(bProposal.basket == address(0));

    ....

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < bProposal.weights.length; i++) {
        ...
    }
    ...
    return newBasket;
}
```

5.  Since no weights and tokens were in this proposal so no token transfer is required (`bProposal.weights.length` will be 0 so loop won't run)

6.  Basket gets created and user becomes publisher for this basket

```solidity
newBasket.mintTo(BASE, msg.sender);
_proposals[idNumber].basket = address(newBasket);
```

7.  Publisher owned address calls the mint function with say amount 10 on `Basket.sol` contract

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount) public override {
    mintTo(amount, msg.sender);
}

function mintTo(uint256 amount, address to) public override {
    ...

    pullUnderlying(amount, msg.sender);

    _mint(to, amount);

    ...
}
```

8.  Since there is no weights so `pullUnderlying` function does nothing (weights.length is 0)

```solidity
function pullUnderlying(uint256 amount, address from) private {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        uint256 tokenAmount = amount * weights[i] * ibRatio / BASE / BASE;
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), tokenAmount);
    }
}
```

9.  Full amount 10 is minted to Publisher owned address setting `balanceOf(msg.sender) = 10`

```solidity
_mint(to, amount);
```

10. Now Publisher calls the `publishNewIndex` to set new weights. Since `pendingWeights.pending` is false, else condition gets executed

```solidity
function publishNewIndex(address[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _weights) onlyPublisher public override {
    validateWeights(_tokens, _weights);

    if (pendingWeights.pending) {
        require(block.number >= pendingWeights.block + TIMELOCK_DURATION);
        if (auction.auctionOngoing() == false) {
            auction.startAuction();

            emit PublishedNewIndex(publisher);
        } else if (auction.hasBonded()) {

        } else {
            auction.killAuction();

            pendingWeights.tokens = _tokens;
            pendingWeights.weights = _weights;
            pendingWeights.block = block.number;
        }
    } else {
        pendingWeights.pending = true;
        pendingWeights.tokens = _tokens;
        pendingWeights.weights = _weights;
        pendingWeights.block = block.number;
    }
}
```

11. Publisher calls the `publishNewIndex` again which starts the Auction. This auction is later settled using the `settleAuction` function in Auction contract

12. Publisher owned address can now call burn and get the amount 10 even though he never made the payment since his `balanceOf(msg.sender) = 10` (Step 9)

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount) public override {
    require(auction.auctionOngoing() == false);
    require(amount > 0);
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount);

    handleFees();

    pushUnderlying(amount, msg.sender);
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    
    emit Burned(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `validateWeights` to check for 0 length token

```solidity
function validateWeights(address[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _weights) public override pure {
    require(_tokens.length>0);
    ...
}
```

## [[M-22] Incorrect data location specifier can be abused to cause DoS and fund loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/168)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by bw and pauliax_

#### Impact

The `withdrawBounty()` loops through the `\_bounties` array looking for active bounties and transferring amounts from active ones. However, the data location specifier used for bounty is memory which makes a copy of the `\_bounties` array member instead of a reference. So when bounty.active is set to false, this is changing only the memory copy and not the array element of the storage variable. This results in bounties never being set to inactive, keeping them always active forever and every `withdrawBounty()` will attempt to transfer bounty amount from the Auction contract to the msg.sender.

Therefore, while the transfer will work the first time, subsequent attempts to claim this bounty will revert on transfer (because the Auction contract will not have required amount of bounty tokens) causing `withdrawBounty()` to always revert and therefore preventing settling of any auction.

A malicious attacker can add a tiny bounty on any/every Auction contract to prevent any reindexing on that contract to happen because it will always revert on auction settling. This can be used to cause DoS on any `auctionBonder` so as to make them lose their bondAmount because their bonded auction cannot be settled.

## [[M-23] Auction settler can steal user funds if bond timestamp is high enough](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiprotocol-findings/issues/45)
_Submitted by kenzo_

After an auction has started, as time passes and according to the `bondTimestamp`, `newRatio` (which starts at `2\*ibRatio`) gets smaller and smaller and therefore less and less tokens need to remain in the basket.
This is not capped, and after a while, `newRatio` can become smaller than current `ibRatio`.

#### Impact

If for some reason nobody has settled an auction and the publisher didn't stop it, a malicious user can wait until `newRatio < ibRatio`, or even until `newRatio \~= 0` (for an initial `ibRatio` of \~1e18 this happens after less than 3.5 days after auction started), and then bond and settle and steal user funds.

#### Proof of Concept

These are the vulnerable lines:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L89:#L99>

```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondTimestamp - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;

for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {
    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;
    require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);
}
```

The function verifies that `pendingTokens[i].balanceOf(basket) >= basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE`. This is the formula that will be used later to mint/burn/withdraw user funds.
As bondTimestamp increases, newRatio will get smaller, and there is no check on this.
After a while we'll arrive at a point where `newRatio ~= 0`, so `tokensNeeded = newRatio*(...) ~= 0`, so the attacker could withdraw nearly all the tokens using outputTokens and outputWeights, and leave just scraps in the basket.

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Your needed condition/math might be different, and you might also choose to burn the bond while you're at it, but I think at the minimum you should add a sanity check in settleAuction:

    require (newRatio > basket.ibRatio());
