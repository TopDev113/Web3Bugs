# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Trader Joe contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 25—January 27 2022.

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Users can lose value in emergency state](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/199)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by static_

Imagine the following sequence of events:

*   `LaunchEvent.createPair()` is called which sets `wavaxReserve = 0`, adds liquidity to the pair and receives `lpSupply` LP tokens.
*   `LaunchEvent.allowEmergencyWithdraw()` is called which enters emergency / paused mode and disallows normal withdrawals.
*   Users can only call `LaunchEvent.emergencyWithdraw` which reverts as the WAVAX reserve was already used to provide liquidity and cannot be paid out. Users don't receive their LP tokens either. The users lost their entire deposit in this case.

#### Recommendation

Consider paying out LP tokens in `emergencyWithdraw`.

## [[H-02] Wrong token allocation computation for token decimals != 18 if floor price not reached](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/193)
_Submitted by cmichel_

In `LaunchEvent.createPair`, when the floor price is not reached (`floorPrice > wavaxReserve * 1e18 / tokenAllocated`), the tokens to be sent to the pool are lowered to match the raised WAVAX at the floor price.

Note that the `floorPrice` is supposed to have a precision of 18:

> /// @param \_floorPrice Price of each token in AVAX, scaled to 1e18

The `floorPrice > (wavaxReserve * 1e18) / tokenAllocated` check is correct but the `tokenAllocated` computation involves the `token` decimals:

```solidity
// @audit should be wavaxReserve * 1e18 / floorPrice
tokenAllocated = (wavaxReserve * 10**token.decimals()) / floorPrice;
```

This computation does not work for `token`s that don't have 18 decimals.

#### Example

Assume I want to sell `1.0 wBTC = 1e8 wBTC` (8 decimals) at `2,000.0 AVAX = 2,000 * 1e18 AVAX`.
The `floorPrice` is `2000e18 * 1e18 / 1e8 = 2e31`

Assume the Launch event only raised `1,000.0 AVAX` - half of the floor price for the issued token amount of `1.0 WBTC` (it should therefore allocate only half a WBTC) - and the token amount will be reduced as: `floorPrice = 2e31 > 1000e18 * 1e18 / 1e8 = 1e31 = actualPrice`.
Then, `tokenAllocated = 1000e18 * 1e8 / 2e31 = 1e29 / 2e31 = 0` and no tokens would be allocated, instead of `0.5 WBTC = 0.5e8 WBTC`.

The computation should be `tokenAllocated = wavaxReserve * 1e18 / floorPrice = 1000e18 * 1e18 / 2e31 = 1e39 / 2e31 = 10e38 / 2e31 = 5e7 = 0.5e8`.

#### Recommendation

The new `tokenAllocated` computation should be `tokenAllocated = wavaxReserve * 1e18 / floorPrice;`.

## [[M-02] Owner of LaunchEvent token has the ability to DOS attack the event](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/121)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by TomFrenchBlockchain_

The owner of the token for which the LaunchEvent was created, has the ability to DOS attack the event. They can prevent the LaunchEvent from creating a JoePair which in turn limits the access to the following two functions: `withdrawLiquidity()` & `withdrawIncentives()`. Thus, stopping anybody from withdrawing their LP tokens.

The owner of the RocketJoe platform has the ability to enable the emergency withdrawal allowing the depositors to take back their AVAX. But, they lose their burned rJOE tokens and the gas fees.

The dev team might use this attack vector if they think the price of their token is too low. In that case, they can DOS attack the LaunchEvent. If the RocketJoe owner enables the emergency withdrawal, the dev team is able to take back their initial deposit. Thus, they don't lose anything but their reputation.

#### Proof of Concept

When `createPair()` is called, the function checks whether a pair already exists. If it does, the transaction is reverted: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L382-L389>

Anybody is able to create a new JoePair using the existing TraderJoe contracts. If someone owns both AVAX and the LaunchEvent token, they are able to create a new pair and deposit a small amount of liquidity. Thus, the `totalSupply` will be `> 0`. Meaning, at that point, the call to `createPair()` fails. Per design, the LaunchEvent will be used to issue a token to the public market. So only the dev team and its trusted parties have access to the necessary tokens to create a pair and provide liquidity.

<https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/traderjoe/JoeFactory.sol#L30>

<https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/traderjoe/JoePair.sol#L133>

Since `createPair()` can't be executed the `pair` state variable is never initialized: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L422>

Thus, the following two functions are not reachable any more: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L439>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L469>

If the emergency withdrawal is enabled, the token issuer can take back their deposit: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L510-L516>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If a LaunchEvent for a token has started, only the LaunchEvent contract should be able to create a JoePair for that token. But, this change has to be made to the contracts that are not in the scope of this audit. I don't think there's a possibility to fix this issue within the RocketJoe contracts.

## [[M-03] `createRJLaunchEvent()` can be called by anyone with 1 Wei of `_token` and stop others from creating RJLaunchEvent with the same token anymore](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/247)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by p4st13r4_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/119e12d715ececc31478e833297f124cc15d27c2/contracts/RocketJoeFactory.sol#L97-L132>

```solidity
function createRJLaunchEvent(
    address _issuer,
    uint256 _phaseOneStartTime,
    address _token,
    uint256 _tokenAmount,
    uint256 _tokenIncentivesPercent,
    uint256 _floorPrice,
    uint256 _maxWithdrawPenalty,
    uint256 _fixedWithdrawPenalty,
    uint256 _maxAllocation,
    uint256 _userTimelock,
    uint256 _issuerTimelock
) external override returns (address) {
    require(
        getRJLaunchEvent[_token] == address(0),
        "RJFactory: token has already been issued"
    );
    require(_issuer != address(0), "RJFactory: issuer can't be 0 address");
    require(_token != address(0), "RJFactory: token can't be 0 address");
    require(_token != wavax, "RJFactory: token can't be wavax");
    require(
        _tokenAmount > 0,
        "RJFactory: token amount needs to be greater than 0"
    );
    require(
        IJoeFactory(factory).getPair(_token, wavax) == address(0) ||
            IJoePair(IJoeFactory(factory).getPair(_token, wavax))
                .totalSupply() ==
            0,
        "RJFactory: liquid pair already exists"
    );

    address launchEvent = Clones.clone(eventImplementation);

    // msg.sender needs to approve RocketJoeFactory
    IERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, launchEvent, _tokenAmount);
```

In the current implementation, `RocketJoeFactory.sol#createRJLaunchEvent()` can be called by anyone with at least 1 Wei of `_token`.

This allows a malicious user or attacker to call `createRJLaunchEvent()` with minimal cost and stop others, especially the platform itself or the rightful issuer of the token from creating the RJLaunchEvent.

#### Recommendation

Consider making `createRJLaunchEvent()` only callable by the owner of `RocketJoeFactory`.

## [[M-04] Uninitialized `RocketJoeStaking.lastRewardTimestamp` can inflate `rJoe` supply](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/202)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `RocketJoeStaking.lastRewardTimestamp` is initialized to zero. Usually, this does not matter as `updatePool` is called before the first deposit and when `joeSupply = joe.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0`, it is set to the current time.

```solidity
function updatePool() public {
    if (block.timestamp <= lastRewardTimestamp) {
        return;
    }
    uint256 joeSupply = joe.balanceOf(address(this));

    // @audit lastRewardTimestamp is not initialized. can send 1 Joe to this contract directly => lots of rJoe minted to this contract
    if (joeSupply == 0) {
        lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        return;
    }
    uint256 multiplier = block.timestamp - lastRewardTimestamp;
    uint256 rJoeReward = multiplier * rJoePerSec;
    accRJoePerShare =
        accRJoePerShare +
        (rJoeReward * PRECISION) /
        joeSupply;
    lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    rJoe.mint(address(this), rJoeReward);
}
```

However, if a user first directly transfers `Joe` tokens to the contract before the first `updatePool` call, the `block.timestamp - lastRewardTimestamp = block.timestamp` will be a large timestamp value and lots of `rJoe` will be minted (but not distributed to users).
Even though they are not distributed to the users, inflating the `rJoe` total supply might not be desired.

#### Recommendation

Consider tracking the actual total deposits in a storage variable and using this value instead of the current balance for `joeSupply`.
This way, transferring tokens to the contract has no influence and depositing through `deposit` first calls `updatePool` and initializes `lastRewardTimestamp`.

## [[M-05] Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/170)
_Submitted by harleythedog, also found by sirhashalot_

In `LaunchEvent.sol`, the function `_safeTransferAVAX` is as follows:
```solidity
function _safeTransferAVAX(address _to, uint256 _value) internal {
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(new bytes(0));
    require(success, "LaunchEvent: avax transfer failed");
}
```

This function is utilized in a few different places in the contract. According to the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)), "The low-level functions `call`, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return `true` as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".

As a result, it is possible that this call will fail, but `_safeTransferAVAX` will not notice anything went wrong. In particular, it is possible that the address `rocketJoeFactory.penaltyCollector()` is a deleted contract (perhaps a security flaw was found and `selfdestruct` was called so that users know to use an updated smart contract), but `_safeTransferAVAX` will not revert. If `rocketJoeFactory.penaltyCollector()` is indeed a non-existent contract, it would be better for `_safeTransferAVAX` to revert until an admin can manually correct the `penaltyCollector` in the factory.

For reference, see a similar high severity reported in a Uniswap audit here (report # 9): <https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf>

#### Proof of Concept

See `_safeTransferAVAX` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/a1579f6453bc4bf9fb0db9c627beaa41135438ed/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L620). See how this function is called with `_to` as `rocketJoeFactory.penaltyCollector()` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/a1579f6453bc4bf9fb0db9c627beaa41135438ed/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L371), but this contract's existence is not verified, which is a problem as described above.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.

## [[M-06] possibility of minting rJOE tokens before ownership  is changed to RocketJoeStaking](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/261)
_Submitted by hubble_

There is a possibility of the rJOE tokens in RocketJoeToken.sol to be minted by original owner without staking any JOE, before the ownership is transferred to  RocketJoeStaking

#### Proof of Concept

Contract : RocketJoeToken.sol
Line : 37
function mint(address \_to, uint256 \_amount) external onlyOwner {
\_mint(\_to, \_amount);
}

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The transferOwnership(address) function inherited from Ownable.sol is used to change to a new owner i.e., RocketJoeStaking.
In the RocketJoeToken.sol contract, define and override this function with an additional check that the totalSupply <= 0

## [[M-07] withdrawAVAX() function has call to sender without reentrancy protection ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/32)
_Submitted by jayjonah8_

In LauchEvent.sol the withdrawAVAX() function makes an external call to the msg.sender by way of \_safeTransferAVAX.  This allows the caller to reenter this and other functions in this and other protocol files.  To prevent reentrancy and cross function reentrancy there should be reentrancy guard modifiers placed on the withdrawAVAX() function and any other function that makes external calls to the caller.

## [[M-08] LP Tokens May Be Locked in Contract Due to `allowEmergencyWithdraw()` in Stage 3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/169)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

The function [allowEmergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L520) may be called by the `rocketJoeFactory.owner()` at any time. If it is called while the protocol is in Stage 3 and a pair has been created then the LP tokens will be locked and both issues and depositors will be unable to withdraw.

#### Proof of Concept

If `allowEmergencyWithdraw()`  is called `stopped` is set to `true`. As a result functions [withdrawIncentives()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L468) and [withdrawLiquidity()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L438) will revert due to the `isStopped(false)` modifier reverting.

Additionally, [emergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L494) will revert since all the `WAVAX` and `token` balances have been transferred to the liquidity pool.

Thus, depositors and issuers will have no methods of removing their LP tokens or incentives.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding the requirement `require(address(pair) != address(0), "LaunchEvent: pair not created");` to the function `allowEmergencyWithdraw()`.

## [[M-09] `createPair()` expects zero slippage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/146)
_Submitted by sirhashalot_

The LaunchEvent.sol `createPair()` function calls router.addLiquidity() with a amountADesired == amountAMin and amountBDesired == amountBMin. Because there is no allowance for slippage, if the zero slippage requirement is not met then the addLiquidity() function [will revert](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/5c2ca96c3835e7f2660f2904a1224bb7c8f3b7a7/contracts/traderjoe/JoeRouter02.sol#L52-L57) and prevent users from using the createPair() function. This could be caused either by frontrunning the createPair call or in a situation where the liquidity pool exists but does not allow for zero slippage with the assets it is holding.

#### Proof of Concept

The zero slippage addLiquidity call is found [in LaunchEvent.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/a1579f6453bc4bf9fb0db9c627beaa41135438ed/contracts/LaunchEvent.sol#L411). This code may have been written with the assumption that only Rocket Joe will have a balance of the new token, so no other user could call the addLiquidity function with both assets, since the whitepaper states "Rocket Joe liquidity launch will complete before launchpad public sale release any tokens to the public". However, the new token contract should be considered untrusted and Rocket Joe cannot guarantee where all the new tokens are before phase 3 of the Rocket Joe launch event, which is when `createPair()` is called. The token creator who has control over the token allocation is not controlled by Trader Joe, so an attacker who has early access to the new token can break the outlined assumptions.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider how the launch event functions may break if the new token is launched by an attacker who doesn't follow the assumptions outlined. One solution for this `createPair()` issue is to add an input parameter to the function to handle a slippage allowance.

## [[M-10] Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/12)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by 0x1f8b, bobi, byterocket, Dravee, hack3r-0m, sirhashalot, TomFrenchBlockchain, UncleGrandpa925, and WatchPug_

It is good to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

## [[M-11] Re-enterable Code When Making a Deposit to Stake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/127)
_Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by 0v3rf10w and static_

Note: this attack requires `rJoe` to relinquish control during `tranfer()` which under the current [RocketJoeToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeToken.sol) it does not. Thus this vulnerability is raised as medium rather than high. Although it's not exploitable currently, it is a highly risky code pattern that should be avoided.

This vulnerability would allow the entire rJoe balance to be drained from the contract.

#### Proof of Concept

The function [deposit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeStaking.sol#L96) would be vulnerable to reentrancy if rJoe relinquished control flow.

The following lines show the reward calculations in variable `pending`. These calculations use two state variables `user.amount` and `user.rewardDebt`. Each of these are updated after `_safeRJoeTransfer()`.

Thus if an attacker was able to get control flow during the `rJoe::tranfer()` function they would be able to reenter `deposit()` and the value calculated for `pending`would be the same as the previous iteration hence they would again be transferred `pending` rJoe tokens. During the rJoe transfer the would again gain control of the execution and call `deposit()` again. The process could be repeated until the entire rJoe balance of the contract has been transferred to the attacker.

```solidity
if (user.amount > 0) {
    uint256 pending = (user.amount * accRJoePerShare) /
        PRECISION -
        user.rewardDebt;
    _safeRJoeTransfer(msg.sender, pending);
}
user.amount = user.amount + _amount;
user.rewardDebt = (user.amount * accRJoePerShare) / PRECISION;
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are two possible mitigations. First is to use the [openzeppelin reentrancy guard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) over the `deposit()` function which will prevent multiple deposits being made simultaneously.

The second mitigation is to follow the [checks-effects-interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) pattern. This would involve updating all state variables before making any external calls.

## [[M-12] Pair creation can be denied](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/197)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by harleythedog, UncleGrandpa925, and WatchPug_

The `LaunchEvent.createPair` requires that no previous pool was created for the `WAVAX <> _token` pair.

```solidity
function createPair() external isStopped(false) atPhase(Phase.PhaseThree) {
    (address wavaxAddress, address tokenAddress) = (
        address(WAVAX),
        address(token)
    );
    // @audit grief: anyone can create pair
    require(
        factory.getPair(wavaxAddress, tokenAddress) == address(0),
        "LaunchEvent: pair already created"
    );

    // ...
}
```

A griefer can create a pool for the `WAVAX <> _token` pair by calling [`JoeFactory.createPair(WAVAX, _token)`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x9ad6c38be94206ca50bb0d90783181662f0cfa10#contracts) while the launch event phase 1 or 2 is running.
No liquidity can then be provided and an emergency state must be triggered for users and the issuer to be able to withdraw again.

#### Recommendation

It must be assumed that the pool is already created and even initialized as pool creation and liquidity provisioning is permissionless.
Special attention must be paid if the pool is already initialized with liquidity at a different price than the launch event price.

It would be enough to have a standard min. LP return "slippage" check (using parameter values for `amountAMin/amountBMin` instead of the hardcoded ones in `router.addLiquidity`) in `LaunchEvent.createPair()`.
The function must then be callable with special privileges only, for example, by the issuer.
Alternatively, the slippage check can be hardcoded as a percentage of the raised amounts (`amountADesired = 0.95 * wavaxReserve, amountBDesired = 0.95 * tokenAllocated`).

This will prevent attacks that try to provide LP at a bad pool price as the transaction will revert when receiving less than the slippage parameter.
If the pool is already initialized, it should just get arbitraged to the auction token price and liquidity can then be provided at the expected rate again.

## [[M-13] ERC20 return values not checked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/198)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by Czar102, defsec, hack3r-0m, hyh, Ruhum, saian, Tomio, and WatchPug_

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.
Some tokens do **not** revert if the transfer failed but return `false` instead.
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer.

#### Recommendation

As the Launch event token can be any token, all interactions with it should follow correct EIP20 checks.
We recommend checking the `success` boolean of all `.transfer` and `.transferFrom` calls for the unknown `token` contract.

*   `LaunchEvent.withdrawLiquidity`: `token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);`
*   `LaunchEvent.withdrawIncentives`: `token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);`
*   `LaunchEvent.emergencyWithdraw`: `token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);`
*   `LaunchEvent.skim`: `token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);`
*   `RocketJoeFactory.createRJLaunchEvent`: `IERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, launchEvent, _tokenAmount);`

## [[M-14] Incompatibility With Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/18)
_Submitted by defsec_

The TraderJOE protocol do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeStaking.sol#L133>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe/blob/main/contracts/RocketJoeFactory.sol#L132>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Ensure that to check previous balance/after balance  equals to amount for any rebasing/inflation/deflation
*   Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens
*   Consider supporting deflationary / rebasing / etc tokens by extra checking the balances before/after or strictly inform your users not to use such tokens if they don't want to lose them.

 > It is possible for someone to unknowingly use this functionality with a token that rebases down during the launch event. Just because you don't support a token type, doesn't mean that the design doesn't exist. This is a medium risk, not a low risk, because there is the potential for external interaction to cause a loss of funds.

## [[M-15] Lack of input checks (withrawal penalties should always be greater than 0)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-trader-joe-findings/issues/314)
_Submitted by pedroais_

If penalties are set to 0 the protocol would be vulnerable to price manipulations like the one described in the contest documentation.

#### Proof of Concept

The protocol uses economic penalties to punish withdraws to protect against economic price manipulation attacks. If these penalties are set to 0 in the creation of a token launch the sale would be vulnerable to this kind of attack. The penalties should never be 0 for any token sale.

The economic attack that could be done with 0 penalties is detailed on page 7 of the whitepaper.

<https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/research/blob/main/RocketJoe_Launch_Platform_for_Bootstrapping_Protocol-Owned_Liquidity.pdf>

I consider this to be a medium risk since it could completely invalidate a token launch but it's still unlikely (but possible) the creators will set penalties to 0. This could be done by mistake or by the creators of the launch event to exploit it themselves.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Require penalties to be greater than 0 either in the initializer function or in the factory.
