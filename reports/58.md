# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Mellow Protocol contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between December 2—December 8 2021.

# High Risk Findings (4)
## [[H-01] `YearnVault.sol#pull()` will most certainly fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/121)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/test_brownie/contracts/YearnVault.sol#L84-L101>

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _yTokens.length; i++) {
        if (tokenAmounts[i] == 0) {
            continue;
        }

        IYearnVault yToken = IYearnVault(_yTokens[i]);
        uint256 yTokenAmount = ((tokenAmounts[i] * (10**yToken.decimals())) / yToken.pricePerShare());
        uint256 balance = yToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (yTokenAmount > balance) {
            yTokenAmount = balance;
        }
        if (yTokenAmount == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        yToken.withdraw(yTokenAmount, to, maxLoss);
        (tokenAmounts[i], address(this));
    }
    actualTokenAmounts = tokenAmounts;
```

The actual token withdrew from `yToken.withdraw()` will most certainly be less than the `tokenAmounts[i]`, due to precision loss in the calculation of `yTokenAmount`.

As a result, `IERC20(_vaultTokens[i]).safeTransfer(to, actualTokenAmounts[i]);` in `LpIssuer.sol#withdraw()` will revert due to insufficant balance.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
tokenAmounts[i] = yToken.withdraw(yTokenAmount, to, maxLoss);
```

## [[H-02] Wrong implementation of `performanceFee` can cause users to lose 50% to 100% of their funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/91)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

A certain amount of lp tokens (shares of the vault) will be minted to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury` as `performanceFee`, the amount is calculated based on the `minLpPriceFactor`.

However, the current formula for `toMint` is wrong, which issues more than 100% of the current totalSupply of the lp token to the `strategyPerformanceTreasury` each time. Causing users to lose 50% to 100% of their funds after a few times.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/LpIssuer.sol#L269-L271>

```solidity
address treasury = strategyParams.strategyPerformanceTreasury;
uint256 toMint = (baseSupply * minLpPriceFactor) / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR;
_mint(treasury, toMint);
```

#### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `strategyParams.performanceFee`: `10e7` (1%)

1.  Alice deposited `1,000 USDC`, received `1000` lpToken; the totalSupply of the lpToken is now: `1000`;
2.  3 days later, `baseTvl` increased to `1,001 USDC`, Bob deposited `1 USDC` and trigegred `_chargeFees()`:

*   Expected Result: `strategyPerformanceTreasury` to receive about `0.01` lpToken (1% of 1 USDC);
*   Actual Result: `minLpPriceFactor` is about `1.001`, and `strategyPerformanceTreasury` will received `1001` lpToken as performanceFee; Alice lose 50% of deposited funds.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
address treasury = strategyParams.strategyPerformanceTreasury;
uint256 toMint = (baseSupply * (minLpPriceFactor - CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR) * performanceFee  / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR) / CommonLibrary.DENOMINATOR;
_mint(treasury, toMint);
```

## [[H-03] `UniV3Vault.sol#collectEarnings()` can be front run](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/98)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

For `UniV3Vault`, it seems that lp fees are collected through `collectEarnings()` callable by the `strategy` and reinvested (rebalanced).

However, in the current implementation, unharvested yields are not included in `tvl()`, making it vulnerable to front-run attacks that steal pending yields.

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/UniV3Vault.sol#L100-L122>

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/UniV3Vault.sol#L80-L97>

#### Proof Of Concept

Given:

*   Current `tvl()` is `10 ETH` and `40,000 USDC`;
*   Current unclaimed yields (trading fees) is `1 ETH` and `4,000 USDC`;

1.  `strategy` calls `collectEarnings()` to collect fees and reinvest;
2.  The attacker sends a deposit tx with a higher gas price to deposit `10 ETH` and `40,000 USDC`, take 50% share of the pool;
3.  After the transaction in step 1 is packed, the attacker calls `withdraw()` and retrieves `10.5 ETH` and `42,000 USDC`.

As a result, the attacker has stolen half of the pending yields in about 1 block of time.

#### Recommendation

Consider including fees in `tvl()`.

For the code to calculate fees earned, please reference `_computeFeesEarned()` in G-UNI project:

## [[H-04] AaveVault does not update TVL on deposit/withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/41)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug_

Aave uses **rebasing** tokens which means the token balance `aToken.balanceOf(this)` increases over time with the accrued interest.

The `AaveVault.tvl` uses a cached value that needs to be updated using a `updateTvls` call.

This call is not done when depositing tokens which allows an attacker to deposit tokens, get a fair share *of the old tvl*, update the tvl to include the interest, and then withdraw the LP tokens receiving a larger share of the *new tvl*, receiving back their initial deposit + the share of the interest.
This can be done risk-free in a single transaction.

#### Proof Of Concept

*   Imagine an Aave Vault with a single vault token, and current TVL = `1,000 aTokens`
*   Attacker calls `LPIssuer.push([1000])`. This loads the old, cached `tvl`. No `updateTvl` is called.
*   The `1000` underlying tokens are already balanced as there's only one aToken, then the entire amount is pushed: `aaveVault.transferAndPush([1000])`. This deposists `1000` underlying tokens to the Aave lending pool and returns `actualTokenAmounts = [1000]`. **After that** the internal `_tvls` variable is updated with the latest aTokens. This includes the 1000 aTokens just deposited **but also the new rebased aToken amounts**, the interest the vault received from supplying the tokens since last `updateTvls` call. `_tvls = _tvls + interest + 1000`
*   The LP amount to mint `amountToMint` is still calculated on the old cached `tvl` memory variable, i.e., attacker receives `amount / oldTvl = 1000/1000 = 100%` of existing LP supply
*   Attacker withdraws the LP tokens for 50% of the new TVL (it has been updated in `deposit`'s `transferAndPush` call). Attacker receives `50% * _newTvl = 50% * (2,000 + interest) = 1000 + 0.5 * interest`.
*   Attacker makes a profit of `0.5 * interest`

#### Impact

The interest since the last TVL storage update can be stolen as Aave uses rebasing tokens but the tvl is not first recomputed when depositing.
If the vaults experience low activity a significant amount of interest can accrue which can all be captured by taking a flashloan and depositing and withdrawing a large amount to capture a large share of this interest

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the tvl when depositing and withdrawing before doing anything else.

# Medium Risk Findings (7)
## [[M-01] User deposits don't have min. return checks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `LPIssuer.deposit` first computes *balanced amounts* on the user's defined `tokenAmounts`.
The idea is that LP tokens give the same percentage share of each vault tokens' tvl, therefore the provided amounts should be *balanced*, meaning, the `depositAmount / tvl` ratio should be equal for all vault tokens.

But the strategist can frontrun the user's deposit and rebalance the vault tokens, changing the tvl for each vault token which changes the rebalance.
This frontrun can happen accidentally whenever the strategist rebalances

#### Proof Of Concept

There's a vault with two tokens A and B, tvls are `[500, 1500]`

*   The user provides `[500, 1500]`, expecting to get 50% of the share supply (is minted 100% of old total supply).
*   The strategist rebalances to `[1000, 1000]`
*   The user's balanceFactor is `min(500/1000, 1500/1000) = 1/2`, their balancedAmounts are thus `tvl * balanceFactor = [500, 500]`, the `1000` excess token B are refunded. In the end, they only received `500/(1000+500) = 33.3%` of the total supply but used up all of their token A which they might have wanted to hold on to if they had known they'd only get 33.3% of the supply.

#### Impact

Users can get rekt when depositing as the received LP amount is unpredictable and lead to a trade using a very different balanced token mix that they never intended.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add minimum return amount checks.
Accept a function parameter that can be chosen by the user indicating their *expected LP amount* for their deposit `tokenAmounts`, then check that the actually minted LP token amount is above this parameter.

## [[M-02] Withdraw from `AaveVault` will receive less than actual share](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/82)
_Submitted by gzeon_

#### Impact

`AaveVault` cache `tvl` and update it at the end of each `_push` and `_pull`. When withdrawing from `LpIssuer`,  `tokenAmounts` is calculated using the cached `tvl` to be pulled from `AaveVault`. This will lead to user missing out their share of the accrued interest / donations to Aave since the last `updateTvls`.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/LpIssuer.sol#L150>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `updateTvls` at the beginning of `withdraw` function if the `_subvault` will cache tvl

## [[M-03] Users can avoid paying vault fees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `LPIssuer.deposit/withdraw` function charges protocol\&management\&performance fees through inflating the LP supply in the `_chargeFees` function.
However, this LP fees minting is skipped if the elapsed time is less than the `managementFeeChargeDelay`:

```solidity
if (elapsed < vg.delayedProtocolParams().managementFeeChargeDelay) {
    return;
}
```

This allows a user to avoid paying any fees if they deposit right after a charge fee interaction and withdraw within again `managementFeeChargeDelay` time period.

#### Proof Of Concept

This can be abused heavily on networks where the gas fees are a lot cheaper than the three vault fees:

*   deposit a tiny amount just to trigger the charge fees. This sets `lastFeeCharge`
*   deposit a huge amount, tvl increases significantly
*   let it earn interest. withdraw it before the `managementFeeChargeDelay`. No fees are paid, tvl reduces significantly
*   repeat, fees are only paid on tiny tvl

#### Impact

In the worst case, nobody pays fees by repeating the above actions.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fees must always be charged on each deposit and withdrawal, even within the same block as it could be that a huge interest "harvest" comes in that an attacker sandwiches.
Remove the `if (elapsed < vg.delayedProtocolParams().managementFeeChargeDelay) { return; }` code.

## [[M-04] `ChiefTrader.sol` Wrong implementation of `swapExactInput()` and `swapExactOutput()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/108)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by Meta0xNull_

When a caller calls `ChiefTrader.sol#swapExactInput()`, it will call `ITrader(traderAddress).swapExactInput()`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/trader/ChiefTrader.sol#L59-L59>

```solidity
return ITrader(traderAddress).swapExactInput(0, amount, recipient, path, options);
```

However, in the current implementation, `inputToken` is not approved to the `traderAddress`.

For example, in `UniV3Trader.sol#_swapExactInputSingle`, at L89, it tries to transfer inputToken from `msg.sender` (which is `ChiefTrader`), since it's not approved, this will revert.

Plus, the `inputToken` should also be transferred from the caller before calling the subtrader.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/trader/UniV3Trader.sol#L89-L89>

```solidity
IERC20(input).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

The same problem exists in `swapExactOutput()`:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow/blob/6679e2dd118b33481ee81ad013ece4ea723327b5/mellow-vaults/contracts/trader/ChiefTrader.sol#L63-L75>

```solidity
function swapExactOutput(
    uint256 traderId,
    uint256 amount,
    address,
    PathItem[] calldata path,
    bytes calldata options
) external returns (uint256) {
    require(traderId < _traders.length, TraderExceptionsLibrary.TRADER_NOT_FOUND_EXCEPTION);
    _requireAllowedTokens(path);
    address traderAddress = _traders[traderId];
    address recipient = msg.sender;
    return ITrader(traderAddress).swapExactOutput(0, amount, recipient, path, options);
}
```

#### Recommendation

Approve the `inputToken` to the subtrader and transfer from the caller before calling `ITrader.swapExactInput()` and `ITrader.swapExactOutput()`.

Or maybe just remove support of `swapExactInput()` and `swapExactOutput()` in `ChiefTrader`.

## [[M-05] Admin can break `_numberOfValidTokens`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/49)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by gzeon and 0x1f8b_

The `ProtocolGovernance._numberOfValidTokens` can be decreased by the admin in the `ProtocolGovernance.removeFromTokenWhitelist` function:

```solidity
function removeFromTokenWhitelist(address addr) external {
    require(isAdmin(msg.sender), "ADM");
    _tokensAllowed[addr] = false;
    if (_tokenEverAdded[addr]) {
        // @audit admin can repeatedly call this function and sets _numberOfValidTokens to zero. because they don't flip _tokenEverAdded[addr] here
        --_numberOfValidTokens;
    }
}
```

This function can be called repeatedly until the `_numberOfValidTokens` is zero.

#### Impact

The `_numberOfValidTokens` is wrong and with it the `tokenWhitelist()`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It seems that `_numberOfValidTokens` should only be decreased if the token was previously allowed:

```solidity
function removeFromTokenWhitelist(address addr) external {
    require(isAdmin(msg.sender), "ADM");
    if (_tokensAllowed[addr]) {
        _tokensAllowed[addr] = false;
        --_numberOfValidTokens;
    }
}
```

## [[M-06] UniswapV3's path issue for `swapExactOutput`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by cmichel_

UniswapV3 expects a path object like `(tokenA, feeAB, tokenB, feeBC, tokenC)`.
The `UniV3Trader.swapExactOutput` code tries to reverse this path to get to `(tokenC, feeBC, tokenB, feeAB, tokenA)` but that's not what the `_reverseBytes` function does.
Note that it reverts the entire encoded `path` byte array **byte-by-byte** which breaks the byte-order in a token.
For example, `tokenA` would have every single byte reversed and lead to a different token.

```solidity
function _reverseBytes(bytes memory input) internal pure returns (bytes memory output) {
    /** @audit reverses byte order? */
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < input.length; ++i) output[i] = input[input.length - 1 - i];
}
```

#### Impact

The `UniV3Trader.swapExactOutput` function with multi-hops is broken and cannot be used.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Don't reverse the path byte-by-byte but element-by-element.

## [[M-07] Bad redirects can make it impossible to deposit & withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-mellow-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `GatewayVault._push()` function gets `redirects` from the `strategyParams`.
If `redirects[i] = j`, vault index `i`'s deposits are redirected to vault index `j`.

Note that the deposits for vault index `i` are cleared, as they are redirected:

```solidity
for (uint256 j = 0; j < _vaultTokens.length; j++) {
    uint256 vaultIndex = _subvaultNftsIndex[strategyParams.redirects[i]];
    amountsByVault[vaultIndex][j] += amountsByVault[i][j];
    amountsByVault[i][j] = 0;
}
```

> The same is true for withdrawals in the `_pull` function. Users might not be able to withdraw this way.

If the `redirects` array is misconfigured, it's possible that all `amountsByVault` are set to zero.
For example, if `0` redirects to `1` and `1` redirects to `0`. Or `0` redirects to itself, etc.
There are many misconfigurations that can lead to not being able to deposit to the pool anymore.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `redirects[i] = j` matrix needs to be restricted.
If `i` is redirected to `j`, `j` may not redirect itself.
Check for this when setting the `redirects` array.
