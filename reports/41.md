# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Kuiper contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between October 8—October 10 2021.

_Note: this audit contest originally ran under the name `defiProtocol`._

This contest was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 21 unique vulnerabilities and 71 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 8 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 12 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 16 non-critical recommendations and 34 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Kuiper contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiProtocol), and is composed of 11 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 552 lines of Solidity code and 460 lines of JavaScript.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] Bonding mechanism allows malicious user to DOS auctions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/48)
_Submitted by kenzo_.

A malicious user can listen to the mempool and immediately bond when an auction starts, without aim of settling the auction. As no one can cancel his bond in less than 24h, this will freeze user funds and auction settlement for 24h until his bond is burned and the new index is deleted. The malicious user can then repeat this when a new auction starts.

While the malicious user will have to pay by having his bond burned, it might not be enough of a detriment for the DOS of the basket.

#### Impact

Denial of service of the auction mechanism. The malicious user can hold the basket "hostage" and postpone or prevent implementing new index.
The only way to mitigate it would be to try to front-run the malicious user, obviously not ideal.

#### Proof of Concept

publishAllIndex:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L170>

*   The attacker would listen to this function / PublishedNewIndex event and upon catching it, immediately bond the auction.
*   The publisher has no way to burn a bond before 24h has passed. But even if he could, it would not really help as the attacker could just bond again (though losing funds in the process).

`settleAuction`:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L79>

*   Only the bonder can settle.

`bondBurn`:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L111>

*   Can only burn 24h after bond.

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If we only allow one user to bond, I see no real way to mitigate this attack, because the malicious user could always listen to the mempool and immediately bond when an auction starts and thus lock it.

So we can change to a mechanism that allows many people to bond and only one to settle;
but at that point, I see no point to the bond mechanism any more. So we might as well remove it and let anybody settle the auction.

With the bond mechanism, a potential settler would have 2 options:

*   Bond early: no one else will be able to bond and settle, but the user would need to leave more tokens in the basket (as newRatio starts large and decreases in time)
*   Bond late: the settler might make more money as he will need to leave less tokens in the basket, but he risks that somebody else will bond and settle before him.

Without a bond mechanism, the potential settler would still have these equivalent 2 options:

*   Settle early: take from basket less tokens, but make sure you win the auction
*   Settle late: take from basket more tokens, but risk that somebody settles before you

So that's really equivalent to the bonding scenario.

I might be missing something but at the moment I see no detriment to removing the bonding mechanism.

# Medium Risk Findings (8)
## [[M-01] `Basket.sol#mint()` Malfunction due to extra `nonReentrant` modifier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/59)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by kenzo, pants, and pauliax_.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol/blob/7ca848f2779e2e64ed0b4756c02f0137ecd73e50/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L83-L88>

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount) public nonReentrant override {
    mintTo(amount, msg.sender);
}

function mintTo(uint256 amount, address to) public nonReentrant override {
    require(auction.auctionOngoing() == false);
```

The `mint()` method is malfunction because of the extra `nonReentrant` modifier, as `mintTo` already has a `nonReentrant` modifier.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount) public override {
    mintTo(amount, msg.sender);
}
```

## [[M-02] Setting `Factory.auctionDecrement` to zero causes Denial of Service in `Auction.settleAuction()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/24)
_Submitted by pants_.

The function `Factory.setAuctionDecrement()` allows the owner to set the state variable `Factory.auctionDecrement` to zero.

#### Impact

If `Factory.auctionDecrement` equals zero then the function `Auction.settleAuction()` will always revert due to a division by zero:

    uint256 b = (bondBlock - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();

#### Tool Used

Manual code review.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an appropriate require statement to the function `Factory.setAuctionDecrement()` to disallow setting `Factory.auctionDecrement` to zero.

**[frank-beard (Kuiper) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/24)**  

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/24#issuecomment-997440110):**
 > I agree with the finding, because this shows a way to DOS the protocol, given specific conditions, I will raise the severity to medium



## [[M-03] Setting `Factory.bondPercentDiv` to zero cause Denial of Service in `Auction.bondForRebalance()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/23)
_Submitted by pants_.

The function `Factory.setBondPercentDiv()` allows the owner to set the state variable `Factory.bondPercentDiv` to zero.

#### Impact

If `Factory.bondPercentDiv` equals zero then the function `Auction.bondForRebalance()` will always revert due to a division by zero:

    bondAmount = basketToken.totalSupply() / factory.bondPercentDiv();

#### Tool Used

Manual code review.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an appropriate require statement to the function `Factory.setBondPercentDiv()` to disallow setting `Factory.bondPercentDiv` to zero.

## [[M-04] Fee on transfer tokens do not work within the protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/78)
_Submitted by anon_.

Fee on transfer tokens transfer less tokens in than what would be expect.
This means that the protocol request incorrect amounts when dealing with these tokens.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol/blob/7ca848f2779e2e64ed0b4756c02f0137ecd73e50/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L256>

The protocol should use stored token balances instead of transfer for calculating amounts.

**[frank-beard (Kuiper) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/78)** 

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/78#issuecomment-997464504):**
 > I agree with the finding and the severity.
> Given a `feeOnTransferToken`, the accounting of the protocol will break.
> 
> because this is dependent on an external condition (using `feeOnTransferToken`) this is a medium severity finding



## [[M-05] createBasket re-entrancy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/85)
_Submitted by pauliax_.

#### Impact

function `createBasket` in Factory should also be `nonReentrant` as it interacts with various tokens inside the loop and these tokens may contain callback hooks.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add `nonReentrant` modifier to the declaration of createBasket.

**[frank-beard (Kuiper) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/85)**

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/85#issuecomment-997464699):**
 > I agree that since the function can potentially interact with any ERC20like token, the function is vulnerable to re-entrancy, because we don't have any specific POC for an attack, this is a medium severity finding



## [[M-06] Validations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/84)
_Submitted by pauliax_.

#### Impact

function `setBondPercentDiv` should validate that `newBondPercentDiv` is not 0, or `bondForRebalance` will experience division by zero error otherwise. If you want to allow 0 values, then `bondForRebalance` should accommodate for such a possibility.

function `addBounty` should check that `amount > 0` to prevent empty bounties.

function `setMinLicenseFee` should validate that it is not over 100%: `newMinLicenseFee <= BASE`.

function `mintTo` should validate that 'to' is not an empty address (0x0) to prevent accidental loss of tokens.

function `validateWeights` should validate that token is not this `basket erc20: require(\_tokens\[i] != address(this));`

function `proposeBasketLicense` could validate that `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol` are not empty.

function `setBondPercentDiv` should validate that `newBondPercentDiv > 1`, otherwise it may become impossible to `bondBurn` because then `bondAmount = totalSupply` and calculation of newIbRatio will produce division by zero runtime error. Of course, this value is very unlikely but still would be nice to enforce this algorithmically.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider applying suggested validations to make the protocol more robust.

**[frank-beard (Kuiper) acknowledged and disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/84)**

 > I agree with the warden, adding these checks will provide additional safety guarantees to protocol users (by limiting owner privileges)
> 
> Additionally, some of these setters can be used to DOS the protocol, as such this is a valid medium severity finding



## [[M-07] Basket becomes unusable if everybody burns their shares](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/49)
_Submitted by kenzo_.

While handling the fees, the contract calculates the new `ibRatio` by dividing by `totalSupply`. This can be 0 leading to a division by 0.

#### Impact

If everybody burns their shares, in the next mint, `totalSupply` will be 0, `handleFees` will revert, and so nobody will be able to use the basket anymore.

#### Proof of Concept

Vulnerable line:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/52b74824c42acbcd64248f68c40128fe3a82caf6/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L124>
You can add the following test to Basket.test.js and see that it reverts (..after you remove "nonReentrant" from "mint", see other issue):
```js
it("should divide by 0", async () => {
await basket.connect(addr1).burn(await basket.balanceOf(addr1.address));
await basket.connect(addr2).burn(await basket.balanceOf(addr2.address));
await UNI.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
await COMP.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
await AAVE.connect(addr1).approve(basket.address, ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
await basket.connect(addr1).mint(ethers.BigNumber.from(1));
});
```

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to `handleFees: if totalSupply= 0`, you can just return, no need to calculate new `ibRatio` / fees.
You might want to reset `ibRatio` to BASE at this point.

## [[M-08] Auction bonder can steal user funds if bond block is high enough](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol-findings/issues/51)
_Submitted by kenzo_.

After an auction has started, as time passes and according to the `bondBlock`, `newRatio` (which starts at 2\*ibRatio) gets smaller and smaller and therefore less and less tokens need to remain in the basket.
This is not capped, and after a while, `newRatio` can become smaller than current `ibRatio`.

#### Impact

If for some reason nobody has bonded and settled an auction and the publisher didn't stop it, a malicious user can wait until `newRatio` < `ibRatio`, or even until `newRatio` \~= 0 (for an initial `ibRatio` of \~1e18 this happens after less than 3.5 days after auction started), and then bond and settle and steal user funds.

#### Proof of Concept

These are the vulnerable lines:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-defiprotocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Auction.sol#L95:#L105>

```solidity
uint256 a = factory.auctionMultiplier() * basket.ibRatio();
uint256 b = (bondBlock - auctionStart) * BASE / factory.auctionDecrement();
uint256 newRatio = a - b;

(address[] memory pendingTokens, uint256[] memory pendingWeights) = basket.getPendingWeights();
IERC20 basketAsERC20 = IERC20(address(basket));

for (uint256 i = 0; i < pendingWeights.length; i++) {
    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;
    require(IERC20(pendingTokens[i]).balanceOf(address(basket)) >= tokensNeeded);
}
```

The function verifies that `pendingTokens[i].balanceOf(basket) >= basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE`. This is the formula that will be used later to mint/burn/withdraw user funds.
As bondBlock increases, newRatio will get smaller, and there is no check on this.
After a while we'll arrive at a point where `newRatio ~= 0`, so `tokensNeeded = newRatio*(...) ~= 0`, so the attacker could withdraw nearly all the tokens using outputTokens and outputWeights, and leave just scraps in the basket.

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis, hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Your needed condition/math might be different, and you might also choose to burn the bond while you're at it, but I think at the minimum you should add a sanity check in `settleAuction`:
```solidity
require (newRatio > basket.ibRatio());
```

Maybe you would require `newRatio` to be > BASE but not sure.

 > Agree with @Alex the Entreprenerd. The purpose of the auction is to create an opportunity for participants to rebalance a basket if it is in their interest. However the warden is correct that there can be issues if the `ibRatio` drops too low, or even to 0, which would effectively allow someone to steal funds. We plan to mitigate this by having the auction have a minimum `ibRatio` at which it can be settled.
