# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of PoolTogether smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between July 28â€”July 31.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 22 unique vulnerabilities. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding

Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 4 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 14 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 6 non-critical recommendations and 11 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 PoolTogether micro contest #1 repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether) is comprised of 2 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes ~275 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings

## [[H-01] `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` can swap Yield Source in `SwappableYieldSource` at any time, immediately rugging all funds from old yield source](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/14)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo, also found by 0xRajeev and gpersoon_

The function `swapYieldSource` [SwappableYieldSource.sol` L307](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L307)

Can be called by the owner (deployer / initializer) or Asset Manager. The function will take all funds from the old Yield Source, and transfer them to the new Yield source. Any contract that implement the function `function depositToken() external returns (address)` will pass the check

However, if either the owner or the `assetManager` have malicious intent, this function allows them to instantly rug all funds

1) Create a contract that implements the `function depositToken() external returns (address)`
2) Be the Owner or `AssetManager`
3) Call `setYieldSource` while pointing at your malicious contract
4) Profit

I highly recommend checking that the `YieldSource` is from a trusted registry before allowing this swap.

Alternatively forcing each `Owner` to be a `TimeLock` with at least 48 hours may provide enough security to allow this to be used in practice

## [[H-02] `redeemToken` can fail for certain tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by hickuphh3, pauliax and jonah1005XXX_

The `SwappableYieldSource.redeemToken` function transfers tokens from the contract back to the sender, however, it uses the `ERC20.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, redeemableBalance)` function for this.
Some deposit token implementations might fail as `transferFrom` checks if the contract approved itself for the `redeemableBalance` instead of skipping the allowance check in case the sender is the `from` address.

This can make the transaction revert and the deposited funds will be unrecoverable for the user.

It's recommended to use `_depositToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, redeemableBalance)` instead.

## [[H-03] `setYieldSource` leads to temporary wrong results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

The use of `setYieldSource` leaves the contract in a temporary inconsistent state because it changes the underlying yield source,
but doesn't (yet) transfer the underlying balances, while the shares stay the same.

The function `balanceOfToken` will show the wrong results, because it is based on `_sharesToToken`, which uses `yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))`, that isn't updated yet.

More importantly `supplyTokenTo` will give the wrong amount of shares back:
First it supplies tokens to the `yieldsource`.
Then is calls `_mintShares`, which calls `_tokenToShares`, which calculates the shares, using `yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))`
This `yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))` only contains the just supplied tokens, but doesn't include the tokens from the previous `YieldSource`.
So the wrong amount of shares is given back to the user; they will be given more shares than appropriate which means they can drain funds later on (once `transferFunds` has been done).

It is possible to make use of this problem in the following way:
- monitor the blockchain until you see `setYieldSource` has been done
- immediately call the function `supplyTokenTo` (which can be called because there is no access control on this function)

```solidity
// https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/main/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol
function setYieldSource(IYieldSource _newYieldSource) external `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` returns (bool) {
  _setYieldSource(_newYieldSource);

function _setYieldSource(IYieldSource _newYieldSource) internal {
..
    yieldSource = _newYieldSource;

 function supplyTokenTo(uint256 amount, address to) external override nonReentrant {
   ..
    yieldSource.supplyTokenTo(amount, address(this));
    _mintShares(amount, to);
  }

 function _mintShares(uint256 mintAmount, address to) internal {
    uint256 shares = `_tokenToShares`(mintAmount);
    require(shares > 0, "SwappableYieldSource/shares-gt-zero");
    _mint(to, shares);
  }

 function _tokenToShares(uint256 tokens) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 shares;
    uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
..
      uint256 exchangeMantissa = FixedPoint.calculateMantissa(_totalSupply, yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))); // based on incomplete yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))
      shares = FixedPoint.multiplyUintByMantissa(tokens, exchangeMantissa);


function balanceOfToken(address addr) external override returns (uint256) {
    return _sharesToToken(balanceOf(addr));
  }

 function _sharesToToken(uint256 shares) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 tokens;
    uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
..
      uint256 exchangeMantissa = FixedPoint.calculateMantissa(yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)), _totalSupply); // based on incomplete yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this))
      tokens = FixedPoint.multiplyUintByMantissa(shares, exchangeMantissa);
```

Reocommend removing the function `setYieldSource`  (e.g. only leave `swapYieldSource`)
Or temporally disable actions like `supplyTokenTo`, `redeemToken` and balanceOfToken, after `setYieldSource` and until `transferFunds` has been done.

## [[H-04] `SwappableYieldSource`: Missing same deposit token check in `transferFunds()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/29)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0xRajeev_

`transferFunds()` will transfer funds from a specified yield source `_yieldSource` to the current yield source set in the contract `_currentYieldSource`. However, it fails to check that the deposit tokens are the same. If the specified yield source's assets are of a higher valuation, then a malicious owner or asset manager will be able to exploit and pocket the difference.

Assumptions:
- `_yieldSource` has a deposit token of WETH (18 decimals)
- `_currentYieldSource` has a deposit token of DAI (18 decimals)
- 1 WETH > 1 DAI (definitely true, I'd be really sad otherwise)

Attacker does the following:
1. Deposit 100 DAI into the swappable yield source contract
2. Call `transferFunds(_yieldSource, 100 * 1e18)`
    - `_requireDifferentYieldSource()` passes
    - `_transferFunds(_yieldSource, 100 * 1e18)` is called
        - `_yieldSource.redeemToken(_amount);` â†’ This will transfer 100 WETH out of the `_yieldSource` into the contract
        - `uint256 currentBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(_yieldSource.depositToken()).balanceOf(address(this));` â†’ This will equate to â‰¥ 100 WETH.
        - `require(_amount <= currentBalance, "SwappableYieldSource/transfer-amount-different");` is true since both are `100 * 1e18`
        - `_currentYieldSource.supplyTokenTo(currentBalance, address(this));` â†’ This supplies the transferred 100 DAI from step 1 to the current yield source
    - We now have 100 WETH in the swappable yield source contract
3. Call `transferERC20(WETH, attackerAddress, 100 * 1e18)` to withdraw 100 WETH out of the contract to the attacker's desired address.

`_requireDifferentYieldSource()` should also verify that the yield sources' deposit token addresses are the same.

```jsx
function _requireDifferentYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {
    require(address(_yieldSource) != address(yieldSource), "SwappableYieldSource/same-yield-source");
		require(_newYieldSource.depositToken() == yieldSource.depositToken(), "SwappableYieldSource/different-deposit-token");
}
```

# Medium Risk Findings (4)

## [[M-01] Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/40)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

The `SwappableYieldSource` allows owners and asset managers to set/swap/transfer yield sources/funds. As such, the contract ownership plays a critical role in the protocol.

Given that `AssetManager` is derived from `Ownable`, the ownership management of this contract defaults to `Ownable`â€™s `transferOwnership()` and `renounceOwnership()` methods which are not overridden here. Such critical address transfer/renouncing in one-step is very risky because it is irrecoverable from any mistakes.

Scenario: If an incorrect address, e.g. for which the private key is not known, is used accidentally then it prevents the use of all the `onlyOwner()` functions forever, which includes the changing of various critical addresses and parameters. This use of incorrect address may not even be immediately apparent given that these functions are probably not used immediately. When noticed, due to a failing `onlyOwner()`  or `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager()` function call, it will force the redeployment of these contracts and require appropriate changes and notifications for switching from the old to new address. This will diminish trust in the protocol and incur a significant reputational damage.

See similar [High Risk severity finding](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/hermez.pdf) from Trail-of-Bits Audit of Hermez.

See similar[ Medium Risk severity](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf) finding from Trail-of-Bits Audit of Uniswap V3:

Recommend overriding the inherited methods to null functions and use separate functions for a two-step address change:
1) Approve a new address as a `pendingOwner`
2) A transaction from the `pendingOwner` address claims the pending ownership change.

This mitigates risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the address/ownership change.

Also, consider adding a time-delay for such sensitive actions. And at a minimum, use a multisig owner address and not an EOA.

 > Disagree with sponsor.  A two step process would be a safer implementation.  A multi-sig does not remove human error or the potential risk here. It may be an acceptable risk to the team, but still worth highlighting with the given severity.

 > We have studied this solution and decided to not implement it since it would make it a pretty tedious process to deploy a swappable yield source, especially through the use of our builder which would mean that a user would have to manually `claimOwnership` after deploying a pool. Plus, this contract will be owned by governance so it will be very difficult to transfer it to another owner or renounce ownership.

## [[M-02] Use of `safeApprove` will always cause `approveMax` to revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by pauliax, shw, and cmichel_

Unlike `SwappableYieldSource` which uses `safeIncreaseAllowance` to increase the allowance to `uint256.max`, `mStableYieldSource` uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `safeApprove()` which has been documented as (1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and (2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance `(current allowance == 0)` or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise.

The usage here is intended to allow increase of allowance when it falls low similar to the documented usage in `SwappableYieldSource`. Using it for that scenario will not work as expected because it will always revert if current allowance is != 0. The initial allowance is already set as `uint256.max` in constructor. And once it gets reduced, it can never be increased using this function unless it is invoked when allowance is reduced completely to 0. See issue page for referenced code.

Recommend Using logic similar to `SwappableYieldSource` instead of using `safeApprove()`.

## [[M-03] Inconsistent balance when supplying transfer-on-fee or deflationary tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/52)
_Submitted by shw, also found by cmichel_

The `supplyTokenTo` function of `SwappableYieldSource` assumes that `amount` of `_depositToken` is transferred to itself after calling the `safeTransferFrom` function (and thus it supplies `amount` of token to the yield source). However, this may not be true if the `_depositToken` is a transfer-on-fee token or a deflationary/rebasing token, causing the received amount to be less than the accounted amount. [SwappableYieldSource.sol L211-L212](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L211-L212)

Recommend getting the actual received amount by calculating the difference of token balance before and after the transfer. For example, re-writing line 211-212 to:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = _depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
_depositToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 receivedAmount = _depositToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
yieldSource.supplyTokenTo(receivedAmount, address(this));
```

_Submitted by tensors, also found by hickuphh3, cmichel and GalloDaSballo_

After swapping a yield source, the old yield source still has infinite approval. Infinite approval has been used in large attacks if the yield source isn't perfectly safe ([see furucombo](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L268)).

Recommend decreasing approval after swapping the yield source.

# Low Risk Findings

## [[L-01] Initialization function can be front-run with malicious values](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by cmichel_

The `SwappableYieldSource.sol` has a public visibility initialization function that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contract, if the deployment of this contract does not safely handle initializations via a robust deployment script or a factory contract to prevent front-running.

Impact: Initialization function can be front-run by attackers, allowing them to initialize the contract with malicious values. Also, if initializations are not done atomically with creation, all public/external functions can be accessed before initialization because there are no checks to confirm initializations in those functions.

Reference: See [similar High-severity Finding 9 of Trail of Bits audit of Advanced Blockchain](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/AdvancedBlockchain.pdf) and [Finding 12 from Trail of Bits audit of Hermez Network](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/hermez.pdf).

Recommend ensuring atomic creation+deployment with script or factory contract. Add checks to confirm initialization in public/external functions.

## [[L-02] Missing zero-address checks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/41)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

Zero-address checks as input validation closest to the function beginning is a best-practice. There are two places where an explicit zero-address check is missing which may lead to a later revert, gas wastage or even token burn.

1. Explicit zero-address check is missing [here](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L269) for `_newYieldSource`
 and will revert later down the control flow on [L256](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L256).

2. Missing zero-address check on â€˜toâ€™ address will lead to token burn because imBalances accounts it for the zero-address from which it can never be redeemed using `msg.sender`:
[`MStableYieldSource.sol` L85](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-mstable/blob/0bcbd363936fadf5830e9c48392415695896ddb5/contracts/yield-source/MStableYieldSource.sol#L85)

Recommend adding explicit zero-address checks closest to the function entry.

`approveMaxAmount()` is `onlyOwner` while all other privileged functions use `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager`. This modifier should also be `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager` to prevent situations where owner has added asset managers and renounced ownership which will prevent accessing this approval function thereafter.

Recommend change `onlyOwner` to `onlyOwnerOrAssetManager`.

Overly permissive access control to lets anyone approve max amount. This may be ok but is inconsistent with `SwappableYieldSource.sol` where the similar function is `onlyOwner`.
`onlyOwner`. See issue page for referenced code.

Recommend checking requirements/spec and ensure this is ok or else add `Ownable` inheritance to enforce `onlyOwner` for this function.

## [[L-05] SwappableYieldSource._requireYieldSource is not a guarantee that you are interacting with a valid yield source](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/11)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo_

[`SwappableYieldSource.sol` L74](https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/89cf66a3e3f8df24a082e1cd0a0e80d08953049c/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L74) runs a few checks to see if the function `depositToken` is implemented.

Notice that this is not a guarantee that the target is a valid Yield Source.

This will simply verify that the contract has that method.

Any malicious attacker could implement that function and then set up the Yield Source to steal funds

In order to guarantee that the target is a valid Yield Source, you'd want to create a registry of know Yield Sources, perhaps controlled by governance or by the DAO, and check against that.

Recommend either:
1. Create any contract with just a `function depositToken returns (address)` and you'll be able to add pass the check.
2. Create an on-chain registry of known Yield Sources, either by committee or governance, and use a check against the registry, this will avoid griefing

## [[L-07] `_requireYieldSource` does not check return value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/60)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `_requireYieldSource` function performs a low-level status code and parses the return data even if the call failed as it does not check the first return value (`success`).
It could be the case that non-zero data is returned even though the call failed, and the function would return `true`.

Check the return value or perform a high-level call using the `_yieldSource` interface.

## [[L-08] `_requireYieldSource` not always called](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by pauliax_

The function initialize of `SwappableYieldSource` checks that the yield source is valid via `_requireYieldSource`.
When you change the yield source (via `swapYieldSource` or `setYieldSource`), then the function `_setYieldSource` is called.
However `_setYieldSource`  doesn't explicitly check the yield source via `_requireYieldSource`.

The risk is low because there is an indirect check, by the following check, which only succeeds is `depositToken` is present in the new yield source:
```solidity
     require(_newYieldSource.depositToken() == yieldSource.depositToken(), "`SwappableYieldSource`/different-deposit-token");
```
For maintenance purposes it is more logical to always call `_requireYieldSource`, especially if the check would be made more extensive in the future.
```solidity
//https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/main/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L98
function initialize( IYieldSource _yieldSource, uint8 _decimals, string calldata _symbol, string calldata _name, address _owner) public initializer returns (bool) {
    _requireYieldSource(_yieldSource);

 function _requireYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {
    require(address(_yieldSource) != address(0), "SwappableYieldSource/yieldSource-not-zero-address");
    (, bytes memory depositTokenAddressData) = address(_yieldSource).staticcall(abi.encode(_yieldSource.depositToken.selector));
    bool isInvalidYieldSource;
    if (depositTokenAddressData.length > 0) {
      (address depositTokenAddress) = abi.decode(depositTokenAddressData, (address));
      isInvalidYieldSource = depositTokenAddress != address(0);
    }
    require(isInvalidYieldSource, "SwappableYieldSource/invalid-yield-source");
  }

 function _setYieldSource(IYieldSource _newYieldSource) internal {
    _requireDifferentYieldSource(_newYieldSource);
    require(_newYieldSource.depositToken() == yieldSource.depositToken(), "SwappableYieldSource/different-deposit-token");
...

 function _requireDifferentYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {
    require(address(_yieldSource) != address(yieldSource), "SwappableYieldSource/same-yield-source");
  }
```

Recommend adding the following statement to `_setYieldSource`:
```solidity
_requireYieldSource(_newYieldSource);
```

## [[L-09] Variable name or `isInvalidYieldSource` is confusion](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by hickuphh3 and pauliax_

The function `_requireYieldSource` of the contract `SwappableYieldSource` has a state variable: `isInvalidYieldSource`

You would expect `isInvalidYieldSource` == true would mean the yield source is invalid
However in the source code  `isInvalidYieldSource` == true mean the yield source is valid.

This is confusing for readers and future maintainers. Future maintainers could easily make a mistake and thus introduce vulnerabilities.

```solidity
// https://github.com/pooltogether/swappable-yield-source/blob/main/contracts/SwappableYieldSource.sol#L74
function _requireYieldSource(IYieldSource _yieldSource) internal view {
  require(address(_yieldSource) != address(0), "SwappableYieldSource/yieldSource-not-zero-address");
  (, bytes memory depositTokenAddressData) = address(_yieldSource).staticcall(abi.encode(_yieldSource.depositToken.selector));
  bool isInvalidYieldSource;
  if (depositTokenAddressData.length > 0) {
    (address depositTokenAddress) = abi.decode(depositTokenAddressData, (address));
    isInvalidYieldSource = depositTokenAddress != address(0);
  }
  require(isInvalidYieldSource, "SwappableYieldSource/invalid-yield-source");
}
```

Recommend changing `isInvalidYieldSource` to `isValidYieldSource`

The `FundsTransferred()` event in `_transferFunds()` will report a smaller amount than expected if `currentBalance > _amount`.

This would affect applications utilizing event logs like subgraphs.

Recommend Updating the event emission to `emit FundsTransferred(_yieldSource, currentBalance);`

## [[L-11] `SwappableYieldSource`: `setYieldSource()` should check no deposited tokens in current yield source](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

`setYieldSource()` changes the current yield source to a new yield source. It has similar functionality as `swapYieldSource()`, except that it doesn't transfer deposited funds from the current to the new one. However, it fails to check that it does not have any remaining deposited funds in the current yield source before the transfer.

It is highly recommended for this check to be in place so that funds aren't forgotten / unintentionally lost.

Recommend adding a require check:
`require(yieldSource.balanceOfToken(address(this)); == 0, "SwappableYieldSource/existing-funds-in-current-yield-source")` **before calling `_setYieldSource()

Tokens sent directly to the `MStableYieldSource` will be stuck forever. Consider adding a function that allows an admin to retrieve stuck tokens:
* Balance of `mAsset` - total deposited amount of `mAsset`;
* Similar with credit balances as credits are issued as a separate erc20 token.
* All the other tokens.

_Submitted by pauliax_

Function `supplyTokenTo` should check that `mAssetAmount` and `creditsIssued` > 0 and to != address(0) or if empty to address is provided, it can replace it with msg.sender to prevent potential burn of funds. function `redeemToken` should check that `mAssetAmount` and `creditsBurned` > 0. function `transferERC20` should similarly validate erc20Token, to and amount parameters. function `_mintShares` requires that shares > 0, while `_burnShares` lacks such requirement.
