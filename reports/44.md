# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Tally smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between October 20—October 22 2021.

# High Risk Findings (2)

## [[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/37)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[`Swap.sol L200-L212`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L200-L212)

```solidity
function fillZrxQuote(
    IERC20 zrxBuyTokenAddress,
    address payable zrxTo,
    bytes calldata zrxData,
    uint256 ethAmount
) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
    uint256 originalERC20Balance = 0;
    if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {
        originalERC20Balance = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
    uint256 originalETHBalance = address(this).balance;

    (bool success,) = zrxTo.call{value: ethAmount}(zrxData);
```

A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.

##### Impact
The wallet balances (for the amount up to the allowance limit) of the tokens that users approved to the contract can be stolen.

##### PoC
Given:

*   Alice has approved 1000 WETH to `Swap.sol`;

The attacker can:
```solidity
TallySwap.swapByQuote(
    address(WETH),
    0,
    address(WETH),
    0,
    address(0),
    address(WETH),
    abi.encodeWithSignature(
        "transferFrom(address,address,uint256)",
        address(Alice),
        address(this),
        1000 ether
    )
)
```

As a result, 1000 WETH will be stolen from Alice and sent to the attacker.

This PoC has been tested on a forking network.

##### Recommendation
Consider adding a whitelist for `zrxTo` addresses.

## [[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/34)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by harleythedog_

[`Swap.sol` L200-L225](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L200-L225)

```solidity
function fillZrxQuote(
    IERC20 zrxBuyTokenAddress,
    address payable zrxTo,
    bytes calldata zrxData,
    uint256 ethAmount
) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
    uint256 originalERC20Balance = 0;
    if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {
        originalERC20Balance = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
    uint256 originalETHBalance = address(this).balance;

    (bool success,) = zrxTo.call{value: ethAmount}(zrxData);
    require(success, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Failed to fill quote");

    uint256 ethDelta = address(this).balance.subOrZero(originalETHBalance);
    uint256 erc20Delta;
    if(!signifiesETHOrZero(address(zrxBuyTokenAddress))) {
        erc20Delta = zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)).subOrZero(originalERC20Balance);
        require(erc20Delta > 0, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Didn't receive bought token");
    } else {
        require(ethDelta > 0, "Swap::fillZrxQuote: Didn't receive bought ETH");
    }

    return (erc20Delta, ethDelta);
}
```

When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be `0`.

That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.

Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is `1 ETH` before the swap.

*   A user swaps `10 ETH` to USDC;
*   `originalETHBalance` will be `11 ETH`;
*   If there is `1 ETH` of refund;
*   `ethDelta` will be `0` as the new balance is `2 ETH` and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is `0`.

Similarly, `erc20Delta` is also computed wrong.

Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from `WBTC` to `WBTC`, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, `erc20Delta` will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.

For example, for an arb swap from `1 WBTC` to `1.1 WBTC`, the `ethDelta` will be `0.1 WBTC` while it should be `1.1 WBTC`.

##### Impact
*   User can not get ETH refund for swaps from ETH to ERC20 tokens;
*   Arb swap with the same input and output token will suffer the loss of almost all of their input amount unexpectedly.

##### Recommendation
Consider subtracting the input amount from the originalBalance.

# Medium Risk Findings (3)

## [[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/20)
_Submitted by elprofesor, also found by WatchPug, Koustre, cmichel, JMukesh, and pauliax_

#### Impact
The use of `transfer()`  in ` Swap.sol`   may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the `msg.sender`   or `feeRecipient`   is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;

1.  The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
2.  The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units

The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.

#### Proof of Concept
This issue directly impacts the following lines of code:
- [L257](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L257)
- [L173](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L173)
- [L158](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L158)

Examples of similar issues ranked as medium can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-notional-findings/issues/15) and [here, just search for 'M04'](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/opyn-gamma-protocol-audit/). A detailed explanation of why relying on `payable().transfer()` may result in unexpected loss of eth can be found [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)

#### Tools Used
Manual review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Re-entrancy has been accounted for in all functions that reference ` Solidity's   `  transfer() `  . This has been done by using a re-entrancy guard, therefore, we can rely on `  msg.sender.call.value(amount)\`  or using the OpenZeppelin [Address.sendValue library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.5.1/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L63)

## [[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/36)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.

However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).

Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.

[`Swap.sol` L153-L181](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally/blob/c585c214edb58486e0564cb53d87e4831959c08b/contracts/swap/Swap.sol#L153-L181)

```solidity
if (boughtERC20Amount > 0) {
    // take the swap fee from the ERC20 proceeds and return the rest
    uint256 toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee).mul(boughtERC20Amount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR);
    IERC20(zrxBuyTokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, toTransfer);
    // return any refunded ETH
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(boughtETHAmount);

    emit SwappedTokens(
        zrxSellTokenAddress,
        zrxBuyTokenAddress,
        amountToSell,
        boughtERC20Amount,
        boughtERC20Amount.sub(toTransfer)
    );
} else {

    // take the swap fee from the ETH proceeds and return the rest. Note
    // that if any 0x protocol fee is refunded in ETH, it also suffers
    // the swap fee tax
    uint256 toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee).mul(boughtETHAmount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(toTransfer);
    emit SwappedTokens(
        zrxSellTokenAddress,
        zrxBuyTokenAddress,
        amountToSell,
        boughtETHAmount,
        boughtETHAmount.sub(toTransfer)
    );
}
```

## [[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/68)
_Submitted by pants_

Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as "refunded ETH" that wasn't part of the "ERC20" swap.

#### Impact
Users can execute ETH swap without paying swap fees for the ETH the got from the swap.

#### Proof of Concept
The steps of the attack are:

1.  Deploy a malicious contract (denoted by `M`), that will be used for `zrxBuyTokenAddress`.
2.  Call `Swap.swapByQuote()` with `zrxBuyTokenAddress=M` and `minimumAmountReceived=0`. The rest of the arguments should specify our ETH swap, nothing special here.
3.  Define `M` to return `0` and `1` at the first and second times when `fillZrxQuote` calls `zrxBuyTokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this))`, respectively.
4.  As a result, `boughtERC20Amount` now equals `1` and the function will "return any refunded ETH" to the caller, without charging any swap fees on it. This ETH is actually the output of that ETH swap.

#### Tool Used
Manual code review.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Charge swap fees for the "refunded ETH" on ERC20 swaps (when `boughtERC20Amount > 0`), or require `boughtETHAmount == 0`.

 > Still working through whether this is an issue we're truly worried about; in particular, if you want to do this, you probably might as well use the 0x API to swap directly.
>
> Nonetheless, it's overshadowed by #37, which will likely lead to changes that will make this impractical as well.

**[0xean (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/68#issuecomment-962451293):**
 > Downgrading to severity 2 as this would lead to "leaked value" as only the fees are lost by the protocol in this attack vector and customer assets aren't being stolen.
