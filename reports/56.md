# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of yAxis contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 16â€”November 18 2021.

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 15 unique vulnerabilities and 67 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 1 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 12 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 19 non-critical recommendations and 33 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 yAxis contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis), and is composed of 184 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 9265 lines of Solidity code and 7712 lines of JavaScript.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] `YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#withdraw()` will most certainly fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

The actual token withdrawn from `vault.withdraw()` will most certainly less than the `_amount`, due to precision loss in `_tokensToShares()` and `vault.withdraw()`.

As a result, `IDetailedERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount)` will revert due to insufficant balance.

Based on the simulation we ran, it will fail `99.99%` of the time unless the `pps == 1e18`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/146febcb61ae7fe20b0920849c4f4bbe111c6ba7/contracts/v3/alchemix/adapters/YaxisVaultAdapter.sol#L68-L72>

```solidity
function withdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external override onlyAdmin {
    vault.withdraw(_tokensToShares(_amount));
    address _token = vault.getToken();
    IDetailedERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/146febcb61ae7fe20b0920849c4f4bbe111c6ba7/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L181-L187>

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 _shares
)
    public
    override
{
    uint256 _amount = (balance().mul(_shares)).div(IERC20(address(vaultToken)).totalSupply());
```

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function withdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external override onlyAdmin {
    address _token = vault.getToken();
    uint256 beforeBalance = IDetailedERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
    
    vault.withdraw(_tokensToShares(_amount));

    IDetailedERC20(_token).safeTransfer(
        _recipient,
        IDetailedERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - beforeBalance
    );
}
```

## [[H-02] CDP.sol update overwrites user's credit on every positive increment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

#### Impact

Within `CDP.sol` (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/alchemix/libraries/alchemist/CDP.sol>) there is a function called update. This function slowly decreases the debt of a position as yield is earned, until the debt is fully paid off, and the idea is then that the credit should begin incrementing as more yield is accumulated. However, the current logic to increment the totalCredit is this line of code (line 39 of `CDP.sol`):

`\_self.totalCredit = \_earnedYield.sub(\_currentTotalDebt);`

Notice that that each time update is called, this overwrites the previous totalCredit with the incremental credit accumulated. The line should instead be:

`\_self.totalCredit = \_self.totalCredit.add(\_earnedYield.sub(\_currentTotalDebt));`

Indeed, look at the function `getUpdatedTotalCredit`, it returns the value:

`\_self.totalCredit + (\_unclaimedYield - \_currentTotalDebt);`

So it is obviously intended that the `totalCredit` should keep increasing over time instead of being overwritten on each update with a small value. The impact of this issue is large - the credit of every position will always be overwritten and the correct information will be lost forever. User's credit should grow over time, but instead it is overwritten with a small value every time update is called.

#### Proof of Concept

See line 39 in `CDP.sol` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/alchemix/libraries/alchemist/CDP.sol#:~:text=_self.totalCredit%20%3D%20_earnedYield.sub(_currentTotalDebt)%3B>

#### Tools Used

Manual inspection.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change code as described above to increment `totalCredit` instead of overwrite it.

**[Xuefeng-Zhu (yAxis) disputed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-985278604):**

**[0xleastwood (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-998542307):**
 > It seems like if `_self.totalDebt` is already zero and yield has been earned by the protocol, `_self.totalCredit` will be overwritten. This doesn't seem ideal, could you clarify why the issue is incorrect?

# Medium Risk Findings (1)
## [[M-01] Prevent Minting During Emergency Exit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis-findings/issues/12)
_Submitted by TimmyToes, also found by defsec_

#### Impact

Potential increased financial loss during security incident.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-yaxis/blob/0311dd421fb78f4f174aca034e8239d1e80075fe/contracts/v3/alchemix/Alchemist.sol#L611>

Consider a critical incident where a vault is being drained or in danger of being drained due to a vulnerability within the vault or its strategies.

At this stage, you want to trigger emergency exit and users want to withdraw their funds and repay/liquidate to enable the withdrawal of funds. However, minting against debt does not seem like a desirable behaviour at this time. It only seems to enable unaware users to get themselves into trouble by locking up their funds, or allow an attacker to do more damage.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Convert emergency exit check to a modifier, award wardens who made that suggestion, and then apply that modifier here.

Alternatively, it is possible that the team might want to allow minting against credit: users minting against credit would effectively be cashing out their rewards. This might be seen as desirable during emergency exit, or it might be seen as a potential extra source of risk. If this is desired, then the emergency exit check could be placed at line 624 with a modified message, instructing users to only use credit.
