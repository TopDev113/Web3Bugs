# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Sandclock contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between January 6â€”January 12 2022.

## Wardens

36 Wardens contributed reports to the Sandclock contest:

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 41 unique vulnerabilities and 58 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 5 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 15 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 21 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 17 non-critical recommendations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Sandclock contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock), and is composed of 9 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1400 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (5)
## [[H-01] `forceUnsponsor()` may open a window for attackers to manipulate the `_totalShares` and freeze users' funds at a certain deposit amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/168)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L390-L401>

```solidity
if (_force && sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()) {
    sponsorToTransfer = totalUnderlying();
} else if (!_force) {
    require(
        sponsorToTransfer <= totalUnderlying(),
        "Vault: not enough funds to unsponsor"
    );
}

totalSponsored -= sponsorAmount;

underlying.safeTransfer(_to, sponsorToTransfer);
```

When `sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()`, the contract will transfer `totalUnderlying()` to `sponsorToTransfer`, even if there are other depositors and `totalShares` > 0.

After that, and before others despoiting into the Vault, the Attacker can send `1 wei` underlying token, then cal `deposit()` with 0.1 \* 1e18 , since `newShares  = (_amount * _totalShares) / _totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored` and `_totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored` is `1`, with a tiny amount of underlying token, `newShares` will become extremly large.

As we stated in issue [#166](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/166), when the value of `totalShares` is manipulated precisely, the attacker can plant a bomb, and the contract will not work when the deposit/withdraw amount reaches a certain value, freezing the user's funds.

However, this issue is not caused by lack of reentrancy protection, therefore it cant be solved by the same solution in issue [#166](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/166).

#### Recommendation

Consider adding a minimum balance reserve (eg. 1e18 Wei) that cannot be withdrawn by anyone in any case. It can be transferred in alongside with the deployment by the deployer.

This should make it safe or at least make it extremely hard or expensive for the attacker to initiate such an attack.

## [[H-02] Withdrawers can get more value returned than expected with reentrant call](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/32)
_Submitted by camden, also found by cmichel and harleythedog_

The impact of this is that users can get significantly more UST withdrawn than they would be alotted if they had done non-reentrant withdraw calls.

#### Proof of Concept

Here's an outline of the attack:

Assume the vault has 100 UST in it.
The attacker makes two deposits of 100UST and waits for them to be withdrawable.
The attacker triggers a withdraw one of their deposit positions.
The vault code executes until it reaches this point: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L565>
Since the attacker is the claimer, the vault will call back to the attacker.
Inside `onDepositBurned`, trigger another 100 UST deposit.
Since `claimers.onWithdraw` has already been called, reducing the amount of shares, but the UST hasn't been transferred yet, the vault will compute the amount of UST to be withdrawn based on an unexpected value for `_totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored` (300).
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L618>

After the attack, the attacker will have significantly more than if they had withdrawn without reentrancy.

Here's my proof of concept showing a very similar exploit with `deposit`, but I think it's enough to illustrate the point. I have a forge repo if you want to see it, just ping me on discord.

## [[H-03] Vaults with non-UST underlying asset vulnerable to flash loan attack on curve pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by camden, also found by cccz, cmichel, danb, defsec, harleythedog, hyh, kenzo, leastwood, palina, pauliax, pmerkleplant, Ruhum, WatchPug, and ye0lde_

In short, the `NonUSTStrategy` is vulnerable to attacks by flash loans on curve pools.

Here's an outline of the attack:

*   Assume there is a vault with DAI underlying and a `NonUSTStrategy` with a DAI / UST curve pool
*   Take out a flash loan of DAI
*   Exchange a ton of DAI for UST
*   The exchange rate from DAI to UST has gone up (!!)
*   Withdraw or deposit from vault with more favorable terms than market
*   Transfer back UST to DAI
*   Repay flash loan

#### Proof of Concept

Here is my proof of concept:

## [[H-04] deposit() function is open to reentrancy attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/3)
_Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by bugwriter001, camden, cccz, cmichel, danb, defsec, Fitraldys, harleythedog, hickuphh3, jayjonah8, kenzo, leastwood, onewayfunction, pedroais, and WatchPug_

In `Vault.sol` the `deposit()` function is left wide open to reentrancy attacks.  The function eventually calls `\_createDeposit() => \_createClaim()` which calls `depositors.mint()` which will then mint an NFT.  When the NFT is minted the sender will receive a callback which can then be used to call the `deposit()` function again before execution is finished.  An attacker can do this minting multiple NFT's for themselves.  `claimers.mint()` is also called in the same function which can also be used to call back into the deposit function before execution is complete.  Since there are several state updates before and after NFT's are minted this can be used to further manipulate the protocol like with `newShares` which is called before minting.  This is not counting what an attacker can do with cross function reentrancy entering into several other protocol functions (like withdraw) before code execution is complete further manipulating the system.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L476>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Reentrancy guard modifiers should be placed on the `deposit()`, `withdraw()` and all other important protocol functions to prevent devastating attacks.

## [[H-05] sponsor() function in open to reentrancy attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by camden_

In `Vault.sol` the `sponsor()` function does not have a reentrancy guard allowing an attacker to reenter the function because the `depositors.mint()` function has as callback to the msg.sender.  Since there are state updates after the call to `depositors.mint()` function this is especially dangerous.  An attacker can make it so the totalSponsored amount is only updated once after calling `mint()` several times since the update takes place after the callback.  The same will be true for the Sponsored event that is emitted.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L244>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A reentrancy guard modifier should be added to the sponsor() function in Vault.sol

# Medium Risk Findings (15)
## [[M-01] Late users will take more losses than expected when the underlying contract (`EthAnchor`) suffers investment losses](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/156)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

Even though it's unlikely in practice, but in theory, the underlying contract (`EthAnchor`) may suffer investment losses and causing decreasing of the PPS of AUST token. (There are codes that considered this situation in the codebase. eg. handling of `depositShares > claimerShares`).

However, when this happens, the late users will suffer more losses than expected than the users that withdraw earlier. The last few users may lose all their funds while the first users can get back 100% of their deposits.

#### Proof of Concept

    // ### for deposits: d1, d2, d3, the beneficiary are: c1, c2, c2
        depositAmount          claimerShares
    d1: + 100e18           c1: + 100e36
    d2: + 100e18           c2: + 100e36
    d3: + 100e18           c2: + 100e36

    depositAmount of d1, d2, d3 = 100e18
    c1 claimerShares: 100e36
    c2 claimerShares: 200e36
    total shares: 300e36


    // ### when the PPS of AUST drop by 50% 
    totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored: 300e18 -> 150e18

    // ### d2 withdraw
    c2 claimerShares: 200e36
    d2 depositAmount: 100e18
    d2 depositShares: 300e36 * 100e18 / 150e18 = 200e36

    Shares to reduce: 200e36
    c2 claimerShares: 200e36 -> 0
    c2 totalPrincipal: 200e18 -> 100e18
    totalShares: 300e36 -> 100e36

    underlying.safeTransfer(d2, 100e18)
    totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored: 150e18 -> 50e18

#### Root Cause

When the strategy is losing money, `share / underlying` increases, therefore the computed `depositShares`: `depositAmount * share / underlying` will increase unexpectedly.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L544-L548>

While `totalShares` remain unchanged, but the computed `depositShares` is increasing, causing distortion of `depositShares / totalShares`, eg, `âˆ‘ depositShares > totalShares`.

#### Recommendation

In order to properly handle the investment loss of the strategy, consider adding a new storage variable called `totalLoss` to maintain a stable value of `share / adjustedUnderlying`.

```solidity
adjustedUnderlying = underlying + totalLoss
```

## [[M-02] `NonUSTStrategy.sol` Improper handling of swap fees allows attacker to steal funds from other users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/158)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/strategy/NonUSTStrategy.sol#L66-L69>

`NonUSTStrategy` will swap the deposited non-UST assets into UST before depositing to EthAnchor. However, the swap fee is not attributed to the depositor correctly like many other yield farming vaults involving swaps (`ZapIn`).

An attacker can exploit it for the swap fees paid by other users by taking a majority share of the liquidity pool.

#### Root Cause

The swap fee of depositing is not paid by the depositor but evenly distributed among all users.

#### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   A NonUST vault and strategy is created for `FRAX`;
*   The liquidity in FRAX-UST curve pool is relatively small (<\$1M).

The attacker can do the following:

1.  Add \$1M worth of liquidity to the FRAX-UST curve pool, get >50% share of the pool;
2.  Deposit 1M FRAX to the vault, get a `depositAmount` of 1M;
3.  The strategy will swap 1M FRAX to UST via the curve pool, paying a certain amount of swap fee;
4.  Withdraw all the funds from the vault.
5.  Remove the liquidity added in step 1, profit from the swap fee. (A majority portion of the swap fee paid in step 3 can be retrieved by the attacker as the attacker is the majority liquidity provider.)

If the vault happens to have enough balance (from a recent depositor), the attacker can now receive 1M of FRAX.

A more associated attacker may combine this with issue [#160](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/160) and initiate a sandwich attack in step 3 to get even higher profits.

As a result, all other users will suffer fund loss as the swap fee is essentially covered by other users.

#### Recommendation

Consider changing the way new shares are issued:

1.  Swap from Vault asset (eg. FRAX) to UST in `deposit()`;
2.  Using the UST amount out / total underlying UST for the amount of new shares issued to the depositor.

In essence, the depositor should be paying for the swap fee and slippage.

## [[M-03] Centralization Risk: Funds can be frozen when critical key holders lose access to their keys](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/165)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

The current implementation requires trusted key holders (`isTrusted[msg.sender]`) to send transactions (`initRedeemStable()`) to initialize withdrawals from `EthAnchor` before the users can withdraw funds from the contract.

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/strategy/BaseStrategy.sol#L214-L223>

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/strategy/BaseStrategy.sol#L163-L170>

This introduces a high centralization risk, which can cause funds to be frozen in the contract if the key holders lose access to their keys.

#### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `investPerc` = 80%
*   1,000 users deposited 1M UST in total (\$1000 each user in avg), 800k invested into AUST (`EthAnchor`)

If the key holders lose access to their keys ("hit by a bus"). The 800k will be frozen in `EthAnchor` as no one can `initRedeemStable()`.

#### Recommendation

See the recommendation on issue [#157](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/157).

## [[M-04] unsponsor, claimYield and withdraw might fail unexpectedly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/76)
_Submitted by danb, also found by ACai, cmichel, harleythedog, leastwood, palina, pedroais, and WatchPug_

`totalUnderlying()` includes the invested assets, they are not in the contract balance.

when a user calls withdraw, claimYield or unsponsor, the system might not have enough assets in the balance and the transfer would fail.

especially, force unsponsor will always fail, because it tries to transfer the entire `totalUnderlying()`, which the system doesn't have:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L391>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

when the system doesn't have enough balance to make the transfer, withdraw from the strategy.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L290-L293>

```solidity
function totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored() public view returns (uint256) {
    // TODO no invested amount yet
    return totalUnderlying() - totalSponsored;
}
```

As a function that many other functions depended on, `totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored()` can revert on underflow when  `sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()` which is possible and has been considered elsewhere in this contract:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/a90ad3824955327597be00bb0bd183a9c228a4fb/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L390-L392>

```solidity
if (_force && sponsorAmount > totalUnderlying()) {
    sponsorToTransfer = totalUnderlying();
}
```

#### Proof of Concept

*   Underlying token = USDT
*   Swap Fee = 0.04%

1.  Sponsor call `sponsor()` and send 10,000 USDT

*   totalSponsored = 10,000

2.  `NonUSTStrategy.sol#doHardWork()` swapped USDT for UST

*   pendingDeposits = 9,996
*   totalUnderlying() = 9,996

3.  Alice tries to call `deposit()`, the tx will revet due to underflow in `totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored()`.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function totalUnderlyingMinusSponsored() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _totalUnderlying = totalUnderlying();
    if (totalSponsored > _totalUnderlying) {
        return 0;
    }
    return _totalUnderlying - totalSponsored;
}
```

## [[M-07] Vault can't receive deposits if underlying token charges fees on transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/55)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by harleythedog, Tomio, and WatchPug_

Some ERC20 tokens charge a fee for every transfer. If the underlying token of a vault is such a token any deposit to the protocol will fail.

Some tokens have the possibility of adding fees later on, e.g. USDT. So those have to be covered too.

Generally, the user would also receive fewer tokens on withdrawing in such a scenario but that's not the protocol's fault.

I rated the issue as medium since part of the protocol become unavailable in such a situation.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L583-L585>

`_transferAndCheckUnderlying()` is used to deposit and sponsor the vault. It checks that after a `safeTransferFrom()` the same exact amount is sent to the balance of the vault. But, if fees are enabled the values won't match, causing the function to revert. Thus, it won't be able to deposit or sponsor the vault in any way.

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L266>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

One possibility would be to simply not use ERC20 tokens with fees.

## [[M-08] Medium: Consider alternative price feed + ensure _minLockPeriod > 0 to prevent flash loan attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/150)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0x1f8b_

It is critical to ensure that `_minLockPeriod > 0` because it is immutable and cannot be changed once set. A zero `minLockPeriod` will allow for flash loan attacks to occur. Vaults utilising the nonUST strategy are especially susceptible to this attack vector since the strategy utilises the spot price of the pool to calculate the total asset value.

#### Proof of Concept

Assume the vaultâ€™s underlying token is MIM, and the curve pool to be used is the MIM-UST pool. Further assume that both the vault and the strategy holds substantial funds in MIM and UST respectively.

1.  Flash loan MIM from the [Uniswap V3 MIM-USDC pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x298b7c5e0770d151e4c5cf6cca4dae3a3ffc8e27) (currently has \~\$3.5M in MIM at the time of writing).
2.  Convert half of the loaned MIM to UST to inflate and deflate their prices respectively.
3.  Deposit the other half of the loaned MIM into the vault. We expect `curvePool.get_dy_underlying(ustI, underlyingI, ustAssets);` to return a smaller amount than expected because of the previous step. As a result, the attacker is allocated more shares than expected.
4.  Exchange UST back to MIM, bringing back the spot price of MIM-UST to a normal level.
5.  Withdraw funds from the vault. The number of shares to be deducted is lower as a result of (4), with the profit being accounted for as yield.
6.  Claim yield and repay the flash loan.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that `_minLockPeriod` is non-zero in the constructor. Also, given how manipulatable the spot price of the pool can be, it would be wise to consider an alternative price feed.

```jsx
// in Vault#constructor
require(_minLockPeriod > 0, 'zero minLockPeriod');
```

## [[M-09] no use of safeMint() as safe guard for users ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/29)
_Submitted by jayjonah8, also found by bugwriter001, camden, palina, and sirhashalot_

In `Vault.sol` the `deposit()` function eventually calls claimers.mint() and depositers.mint().  Calling mint this way does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them.  `\_safeMint()` should be used with reentrancy guards as a guard to protect the user as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.

## [[M-10] No setter for exchangeRateFeeder, whose address might change in future](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/71)
_Submitted by kenzo_

EthAnchor's docs state that "the contract address of ExchangeRateFeeder may change as adjustments occur".
BaseStrategy does not have a setter to change exchangeRateFeeder after deployment.

#### Impact

Inaccurate/unupdated values from exchangeRateFeeder when calculating vault's total invested assets.

While the strategy's funds could be withdrawn from EthAnchor and migrated to a new strategy with correct exchangeRateFeeder, during this process (which might take time due to EthAnchor's async model) the wrong exchangeRateFeeder will be used to calculate the vault's total invested assets. (The vault's various actions (deposit, claim, withdraw) can not be paused.)

#### Proof of Concept

The exchangeRateFeeder is being used to calculate the vault's invested assets, which is used extensively to calculate the correct amount of shares and amounts: [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/strategy/BaseStrategy.sol#L275)
```solidity
function investedAssets() external view virtual override(IStrategy) returns (uint256) {
    uint256 underlyingBalance = _getUnderlyingBalance() + pendingDeposits;
    uint256 aUstBalance = _getAUstBalance() + pendingRedeems;

    return underlyingBalance + ((exchangeRateFeeder.exchangeRateOf(address(aUstToken), true) 
            * aUstBalance) / 1e18);
}
```

EthAnchor documentation states that unlike other contracts, exchangeRateFeeder is not proxied and it's address may change in future: "the contract address of ExchangeRateFeeder may change as adjustments occur.
" [(ref)](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/ethanchor/ethanchor-contracts/deployed-contracts#core-contracts)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a setter for exchangeRateFeeder.

## [[M-11] Changing a strategy can be bricked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/91)
_Submitted by kenzo, also found by danb and harleythedog_

A vault wouldn't let the strategy be changed unless the strategy holds no funds.

Since anybody can send funds to the strategy, a griefing attack is possible.

#### Impact

Strategy couldn't be changed.

#### Proof of Concept

`setStrategy` requires `strategy.investedAssets() == 0`. [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/Vault.sol#L113:#L116)
`investedAssets` contains the aUST balance and the pending redeems: [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/strategy/BaseStrategy.sol#L271)

    uint256 aUstBalance = _getAUstBalance() + pendingRedeems;

So if a griefer sends 1 wei of aUST to the strategy before it is to be replaced, it would not be able to be replaced. The protocol would then need to redeem the aUST and wait for the process to finish - and the griefer can repeat his griefing. As they say, griefers gonna grief.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider keeping an internal aUST balance of the strategy, which will be updated upon deposit and redeem, and use it (instead of raw aUST balance) to check if the strategy holds no aUST funds.

Another option is to add capability for the strategy to send the aUST to the vault.

> 
> "Additionally, impact-wise: EthAnchor does not accept redeems of less than 10 aUST. This means that if a griefer only sends 1 wei aUST, the protocol would have to repeatedly send additional aUST to the strategy to be able to redeem the griefer's aUST."



## [[M-12] `investedAssets()` Does Not Take Into Consideration The Performance Fee Charged On Strategy Withdrawals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/66)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by danb_

The `investedAssets()` function is implemented by the vault's strategy contracts as a way to express a vault's investments in terms of the underlying currency. While the implementation of this function in `BaseStrategy.sol` and `NonUSTStrategy.sol` is mostly correct. It does not account for the performance fee charged by the treasury as shown in `finishRedeemStable()`.

Therefore, an attacker could avoid paying their fair share of the performance fee by withdrawing their assets before several calls to `finishRedeemStable()` are made and reenter the vault once the fee is charged.

#### Tools Used

Manual code review.
Discussions with the Sandclock team (mostly Ryuhei).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When calculating the `investedAssets()` amount (expressed in the underlying currency), consider calculating the expected performance fee to be charged if all the strategy's assets are withdrawn from the Anchor protocol. This should ensure that `investedAssets()` returns the most accurate amount, preventing users from gaming the protocol.

## [[M-13] Incompatibility With Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/179)
_Submitted by defsec_

The Strategy contracts do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock/blob/main/sandclock/contracts/strategy/BaseStrategy.sol#L221>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

- Make sure token vault accounts for any rebasing/inflation/deflation
- Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens
- Consider to check before/after balance on the vault.

## [[M-14] A Single Malicious Trusted Account Can Takeover Parent Contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-sandclock-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by hickuphh3_

The `requiresTrust()` modifier is used on the strategy, vault and factory contracts to prevent unauthorised accounts from calling restricted functions. Once an account is considered trusted, they are allowed to add and remove accounts by calling `setIsTrusted()` as they see fit.

However, if any single account has its private keys compromised or decides to become malicious on their own, they can remove all other trusted accounts from the `isTrusted` mapping. As a result, they are effectively able to take over the trusted group that controls all restricted functions in the parent contract.

#### Proof of Concept
```solidity
abstract contract Trust {
    event UserTrustUpdated(address indexed user, bool trusted);

    mapping(address => bool) public isTrusted;

    constructor(address initialUser) {
        isTrusted[initialUser] = true;

        emit UserTrustUpdated(initialUser, true);
    }

    function setIsTrusted(address user, bool trusted) public virtual requiresTrust {
        isTrusted[user] = trusted;

        emit UserTrustUpdated(user, trusted);
    }

    modifier requiresTrust() {
        require(isTrusted[msg.sender], "UNTRUSTED");

        _;
    }
}
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider utilising Rari Capital's updated `Auth.sol` contract found [here](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/main/src/auth/Auth.sol). This updated contract gives the `owner` account authority over its underlying trusted accounts, preventing any single account from taking over the trusted group. The `owner` account should point to a multisig managed by the Sandclock team or by a community DAO.
