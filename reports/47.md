# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the BadgerDAO ibBTC Wrapper smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between October 28â€”October 30 2021.

## Wardens

20 Wardens contributed reports to the BadgerDAO ibBTC Wrapper contest:

# High Risk Findings (4)

## [[H-01] The design of `wibBTC` is not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/65)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by gzeon_

Per the documentation, `wibBTC` is designed for a Curve StableSwap pool. However, the design of `wibBTC` makes the balances change dynamically and automatically. This is unusual for an ERC20 token, and it's not fully compatible with the current Curve StableSwap pool.

Specifically, a Curve StableSwap pool will maintain the balances of its `coins` based on the amount of tokens added, removed, and exchanged each time. In another word, it can not adopt the dynamic changes of the balances that happened automatically.

The pool's actual dynamic balance of `wibBTC` will deviate from the recorded balance in the pool contract as the `pricePerShare` increases.

Furthermore, there is no such way in Curve StableSwap similar to the `sync()` function of UNI v2, which will force sync the stored `reserves` to match the balances.

##### PoC
Given:

*   The current `pricePerShare` is: `1`;
*   The Curve pool is newly created with 0 liquidity;

1.  Alice added `100 wibBTC` and `100 wBTC` to the Curve pool; Alice holds 100% of the pool;
2.  After 1 month with no activity (no other users, no trading), and the `pricePerShare` of `ibBTC` increases to `1.2`;
3.  Alice removes all the liquidity from the Curve pool.

While it's expected to receive `150 wibBTC` and `100 wBTC`, Alice actually can only receive `100 wibBTC` and `100 wBTC`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider creating a revised version of the Curve StableSwap contract that can handle dynamic balances properly.

## [[H-02] Approved spender can spend too many tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/43)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug, jonah1005, gzeon, and TomFrench_
The `approve` function has not been overridden and therefore uses the internal *shares*, whereas `transfer(From)` uses the rebalanced amount.

#### Impact
The approved spender may spend more tokens than desired. In fact, the approved amount that can be transferred keeps growing with `pricePerShare`.

Many contracts also use the same amount for the `approve` call as for the amount they want to have transferred in a subsequent `transferFrom` call, and in this case, they approve an amount that is too large (as the approved `shares` amount yields a higher rebalanced amount).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `_allowances` field should track the rebalanced amounts such that the approval value does not grow. (This does not actually require overriding the `approve` function.)
In `transferFrom`, the approvals should then be subtracted by the *transferred* `amount`, not the `amountInShares`:

```solidity
// _allowances are in rebalanced amounts such that they don't grow
// need to subtract the transferred amount
_approve(sender, _msgSender(), _allowances[sender][_msgSender()].sub(amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance"));
```

## [[H-03] `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract will use stalled price for mint/burn if `updatePricePerShare` wasn't run properly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by cmichel, gpersoon, leastwood, hack3r-0m, kenzo, WatchPug, and loop_

#### Impact

Malicious user can monitor `SetPricePerShare` event and, if it was run long enough time ago and market moved, but, since there were no `SetPricePerShare` fired, the contract's `pricePerShare` is outdated, so a user can `mint()` with `pricePerShare` that is current for contract, but outdated for market, then wait for price update and `burn()` with updated `pricePerShare`, yielding risk-free profit at expense of contract holdings.

#### Proof of Concept

`WrappedIbbtcEth` updates `pricePerShare` variable by externally run `updatePricePerShare` function. The variable is then used in mint/burn/transfer functions without any additional checks, even if outdated/stalled. This can happen if the external function wasn't run for any reason.
The variable is used via `balanceToShares` function: [`WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L155)


This is feasible as `updatePricePerShare` to be run by off-chain script being a part of the system, and malfunction of this script leads to contract exposure by stalling the price. The malfunction can happen both by internal reasons (bugs) and by external ones (any system-level dependencies, network outrages).
`updatePricePerShare` function: [`WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` L72](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L72)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The risk comes with system design. Wrapping price updates with contract level variable for gas costs minimization is a viable approach, but it needs to be paired with corner cases handling. One of the ways to reduce the risk is as follows:

Introduce a threshold variable for maximum time elapsed since last `pricePerShare` update to `WrappedIbbtcEth` contract.

Then 2 variants of `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions can be introduced, both check condition {now - time since last price update < threshold}. If condition holds both variants, do the transfer. If it doesn't, then the first variant reverts, while the second do costly price update.
I.e. it will be cheap transfer (that works only if price is recent) and full transfer (that is similar to the first when price is recent, but do price update on its own when price is stalled). This way, this full transfer is guaranteed to run and is usually cheap, costing more if price is stalled and it does the update.

After this, whenever scheduled price update malfunctions (for example because of network conditions), the risk will be limited by market volatility during threshold time at maximum, i.e. capped.

See [issue page](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/86) for example code:

## [[H-04] `WrappedIbbtc` and `WrappedIbbtcEth` contracts do not filter out price feed outliers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/87)
_Submitted by hyh_

#### Impact
If price feed is manipulated in any way or there is any malfunction based volatility on the market, both contracts will pass it on a user.
In the same time it's possible to construct mitigation mechanics for such cases, so user economics would be affected by sustainable price movements only.
As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it's worth adding some complexity to the implementation.

#### Proof of Concept
In `WrappedIbbtcEth` `pricePerShare` variable is updated by externally run `updatePricePerShare` function ([WrappedIbbtcEth.sol L72](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L72)), and then used in mint/burn/transfer functions without additional checks via `balanceToShares` function: [`WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L155)

In `WrappedIbbtc` price is requested via `pricePerShare` function([`WrappedIbbtc.sol` L123](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L123)), and used in the same way without additional checks via `balanceToShares` [function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L147).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Introduce a minting/burning query that runs on a schedule, separating user funds contribution and actual mint/burn. With user deposit or burn, the corresponding action to be added to commitment query, which execution for mint or redeem will later be sparked by off-chain script according to fixed schedule.
This also can be open to public execution with gas compensation incentive, for example as it's done in Tracer protocol: [`PoolKeeper.sol` L131](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/blob/develop/contracts/implementation/PoolKeeper.sol#L131)

Full code of an implementation is too big to include in the report, but viable versions are available publicly (Tracer protocol version can be found at the same repo, [`implementation/PoolCommitter` sol](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/blob/develop/contracts/implementation/PoolCommitter.sol)
).

Once the scheduled mint/redeem query is added, the additional logic to control for price outliers will become possible there, as in this case mint/redeem execution can be conditioned to happen on calm market only, where various definitions of calm can be implemented.
One of the approaches is to keep track of recent prices and require that new price each time be within a threshold from median of their array.

Example:
```solidity
// Introduce small price tracking arrays:
uint256\[] private times;
uint256\[] private prices;

// Current position in array
uint8 curPos;

// Current length, grows from 0 to totalMaxPos as prices are being added
uint8 curMaxPos;

// Maximum length, we track up to totalMaxPos prices
uint8 totalMaxPos = 10;

// Price movement threshold
uint256 moveThreshold = 0.1\*1e18;
```

We omit the full implementation here as it is lengthy enough and can vary.
The key steps are:
*   Run query for scheduled mint/redeem with logic: if next price is greater than median of currently recorded prices by threshold, add it to the records, but do not mint/redeem.
*   That is, when scheduled mint/redeem is run, on new price request, WrappedIbbtcEth.core.pricePerShare() or WrappedIbbtc.oracle.pricePerShare(), get newPrice and calculate current price array median, curMed
*   prices\[curPos] = newPrice
*   if (curMaxPos < totalMaxPos) {curMaxPos += 1}
*   if (curPos == curMaxPos) {curPos = 0} else {curPos += 1}
*   if (absolute_value_of(newPrice - curMed) < moveThreshold \* curMed / 1e18) {do_mint/redeem; return\_0\_status}
*   else {return\_1\_status}

Schedule should be frequent enough, say once per 30 minutes, which is kept while returned status is 0. While threshold condition isn't met and returned status is 1, it runs once per 10 minutes. The parameters here are subject to calibration.

This way if the price movement is sustained the mint/redeem happens after price array median comes to a new equilibrium. If price reverts, the outbreak will not have material effect mint/burn operations. This way the contract vulnerability is considerably reduced as attacker would need to keep distorted price for period long enough, which will happen after the first part of deposit/withdraw cycle. I.e. deposit and mint, burn and redeem operations will happen not simultaneously, preventing flash loans to be used to elevate the quantities, and for price to be effectively distorted it would be needed to keep it so for substantial amount of time.

# Medium Risk Findings (4)

## [[M-01] Unable to transfer `WrappedIbbtc` if Oracle go down](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/20)
_Submitted by gzeon_

#### Impact
In `WrappedIbbtc`, user will not be able to transfer if `oracle.pricePerShare()` (L124) revert. This is because `balanceToShares()` is called in both transfer and `transferFrom`, which included a call to `pricePerShare()`.

If this is the expected behavior, note that `WrappedIbbtcEth` is behaving the opposite as it uses the cached value in a local variable `pricePerShare`, which is only updated upon call to `updatePricePerShare()`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Depending on the specification, one of them need to be changed.

_Submitted by hack3r-0m, also found by defsec_

 oracle can `0` as a price of the share, in that case, 0 will be the denominator in some calculations which can cause reverts from SafeMath (for e.g here: [`WrappedIbbtc.sol` L148](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L148)) resulting in Denial Of Service.

- [`WrappedIbbtc.sol` L123](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L123)


#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a null check to ensure that on every update, the price is greater than 0.

## [[M-03] hard to clear balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/24)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

The contract does not allow users to transfer by share. Therefore, It is hard for users to clear out all the shares.
There will be users using this token with Metamask and it is likely the `pricePerShare` would increase after the user sends transactions. I consider this is a medium-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept
[WrappedIbbtc.sol#L110-L118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtc.sol#L110-L118)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
A new `transferShares` beside the original `transfer()` would build a better UX. sushi's bento box would be a good ref [BentoBox.sol](https://github.com/sushiswap/bentobox/blob/master/contracts/BentoBox.sol)

## [[M-04] No sanity check on `pricePerShare` might lead to lost value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao-findings/issues/68)
_Submitted by kenzo_

`pricePerShare` is read either from an oracle or from ibBTC's core.

If one of these is bugged or exploited, there are no safety checks to prevent loss of funds.

#### Impact
As `pricePerShare` is used to calculate transfer amount, a bug or wrong data retuning a smaller `pricePerShare` than it really is, could result in drainage of wibbtc from Curve pool.

#### Proof of Concept
Curve's swap and remove liquidity functions will both call wibbtc's `transfer` function:
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xFbdCA68601f835b27790D98bbb8eC7f05FDEaA9B#code%23L790
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xFbdCA68601f835b27790D98bbb8eC7f05FDEaA9B#code%23L831
- The `transfer` function calculates the amount to send by calling `balanceToShares`: [`WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` L127](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L127)
- `balanceToShares` calculates the shares (=amount to send) by dividing in `pricePerShare`: [`WrappedIbbtcEth.sol` L156](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-badgerdao/blob/main/contracts/WrappedIbbtcEth.sol#L156)

Therefore, if due to a bug or exploit in ibBTC core / the trusted oracle `pricePerShare` is smaller than it really is, the amount that will be sent will grow larger. So Curve will send to the user/exploiter doing swap/remove liquidity more tokens that he deserves.

#### Tools Used
Manual analysis, hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add sanity check:

`pricePerShare` should never decrease but only increase with time (as ibbtc accrues interest) (validated with DefiDollar team). This means that on every `pricePerShare` read/update, if the new `pricePerShare` is smaller than the current one, we can discard the update as bad data.

This will prevent an exploiter from draining Curve pool's wibbtc reserves by decreasing `pricePerShare`.
