# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of FairSide smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 9â€”November 11 2021.

## [[H-01] Anyone Can Arbitrarily Call `FSDVesting.updateVestedTokens()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/101)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by cmichel, hickuphh3, hyh, rfa, and WatchPug_

#### Impact
The `updateVestedTokens()` function is intended to be called by the `FSD.sol` contract when updating a user's vested token amount. A check is performed to ensure that `_user == beneficiary`, however, as `_user` is a user controlled argument, it is possible to spoof calls to `updateVestedTokens()` such that anyone can arbitrarily add any amount to the vested contract. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the call originated from a trusted/whitelisted source.

There are two main reasons as to why the beneficiary or an attacker would want to call this function:

*   To increase the vested amount such that `calculateVestingClaim()` allows them to withdraw their entire vested amount without waiting the entire duration.
*   An attacker wishes to block withdrawals from other vested contracts by preventing successful calls to `claimVestedTokens()` by the beneficiary account. This can be done by increasing the vested amount such that `safeTransfer()` calls fail due to insufficient token balance within the contract.

#### Tools Used
Manual code review.
Discussions with dev.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Ensure that the `updateVestedTokens()` function is only callable from the `FSD.sol` contract. This can be done by implementing an `onlyFSD` role.

## [[H-02] `FSDVesting`: Claiming tributes should call FSD token's corresponding functions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/28)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by leastwood_

#### Impact
The claiming of staking and governance tributes for the a beneficiary's vested tokens should be no different than other users / EOAs. However, the `claimTribute()` and `claimGovernanceTribute()` are missing the actual claiming calls to the corresponding functions of the FSD token contract. As a result, the accrued rewards are taken from the beneficiary's vested token while not claiming (replenishing) from the FSD token contract.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In addition to what has been mentioned above, the internal accounting for claimedTribute states can be removed because they are already performed in the FSD token contract.

```jsx
// TODO: Remove _claimedTribute and _claimedGovernanceTribute mappings

/**
* @dev Allows claiming of staking tribute by `msg.sender` during their vesting period.
* It updates the claimed status of the vest against the tribute
* being claimed.
*
* Requirements:
* - claiming amount must not be 0.
*/
function claimTribute(uint256 num) external onlyBeneficiary {
    uint256 tribute = fsd.availableTribute(num);
    require(tribute != 0, "FSDVesting::claimTribute: No tribute to claim");
		fsd.claimTribute(num);
    fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tribute);
    emit TributeClaimed(msg.sender, tribute);
}

/**
* @dev Allows claiming of governance tribute by `msg.sender` during their vesting period.
* It updates the claimed status of the vest against the tribute
* being claimed.
*
* Requirements:
* - claiming amount must not be 0.
*/
function claimGovernanceTribute(uint256 num) external onlyBeneficiary {
  uint256 tribute = fsd.availableGovernanceTribute(num);
  require(
    tribute != 0,
    "FSDVesting::claimGovernanceTribute: No governance tribute to claim"
  );
  fsd.claimGovernanceTribute(num);
  fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tribute);
  emit GovernanceTributeClaimed(msg.sender, tribute);
}
```

## [[H-03] Beneficiary cant get `fairSideConviction` NFT unless they only claim once, and only after it's fully vested](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/62)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel_

Based on the context, once the beneficiary claimed all their vesting tokens, they should get the `fairSideConviction` NFT.

However, in the current implementation, if the beneficiary has claimed any amounts before it's fully vested, then they will never be able to get the `fairSideConviction` NFT, because at L138, it requires the `tokenbClaim` to be equal to the initial vesting amount.

[`FSDVesting.sol` L124-L142](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/20c68793f48ee2678508b9d3a1bae917c007b712/contracts/token/FSDVesting.sol#L124-L142)



```solidity
function claimVestedTokens() external override onlyBeneficiary {
    uint256 tokenClaim = calculateVestingClaim();
    require(
        tokenClaim > 0,
        "FSDVesting::claimVestedTokens: Zero claimable tokens"
    );

    totalClaimed = totalClaimed.add(tokenClaim);
    lastClaimAt = block.timestamp;

    fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokenClaim);

    emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, tokenClaim, block.timestamp);

    if (amount == tokenClaim) {
        uint256 tokenId = fsd.tokenizeConviction(0);
        fairSideConviction.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
}
```

##### Recommendation
Change to:

```solidity
function claimVestedTokens() external override onlyBeneficiary {
    uint256 tokenClaim = calculateVestingClaim();
    require(
        tokenClaim > 0,
        "FSDVesting::claimVestedTokens: Zero claimable tokens"
    );

    totalClaimed = totalClaimed.add(tokenClaim);
    lastClaimAt = block.timestamp;

    fsd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokenClaim);

    emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, tokenClaim, block.timestamp);

    if (amount == totalClaimed) {
        uint256 tokenId = fsd.tokenizeConviction(0);
        fairSideConviction.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
}
```

## [[H-04] ERC20ConvictionScore._writeCheckpoint` does not write to storage on same block](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/69)
_Submitted by cmichel_

In `ERC20ConvictionScore._writeCheckpoint`, when the checkpoint is overwritten (`checkpoint.fromBlock == blockNumber`), the new value is set to the `memory checkpoint` structure and never written to storage.

```solidity
// @audit this is MEMORY, setting new convictionScore doesn't write to storage
Checkpoint memory checkpoint = checkpoints[user][nCheckpoints - 1];

if (nCheckpoints > 0 && checkpoint.fromBlock == blockNumber) {
    checkpoint.convictionScore = newCS;
}
```

Users that have their conviction score updated several times in the same block will only have their first score persisted.

###### POC
*   User updates their conviction with `updateConvictionScore(user)`
*   **In the same block**, the user now redeems an NFT conviction using `acquireConviction(id)`. This calls `_increaseConvictionScore(user, amount)` which calls `_writeCheckpoint(..., prevConvictionScore + amount)`. The updated checkpoint is **not** written to storage, and the user lost their conviction NFT. (The conviction/governance totals might still be updated though, leading to a discrepancy.)

#### Impact
Users that have their conviction score updated several times in the same block will only have their first score persisted.

This also applies to the total conviction scores `TOTAL_CONVICTION_SCORE` and `TOTAL_GOVERNANCE_SCORE` (see `_updateConvictionTotals`) which is a big issue as these are updated a lot of times each block.

It can also be used for inflating a user's conviction by first calling `updateConvictionScore` and then creating conviction tokens with `tokenizeConviction`. The `_resetConviction` will not actually reset the user's conviction.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Define the `checkpoint` variable as a `storage` pointer:

```solidity
Checkpoint storage checkpoint = checkpoints[user][nCheckpoints - 1];
```

# Medium Risk Findings (2)

## [[M-01] `TributeAccrual.availableTribute()` & `TributeAccrual.availableGovernanceTribute()` Distributes Tributes Unfairly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/104)
_Submitted by leastwood_

#### Impact

Conviction scores are calculated by taking the user's balance and multiplying it by the time elapsed. This score is updated upon each token transfer, or alternatively by directly calling `ERC20ConvictionScore.updateConvictionScore()`. The `availableTribute()` and `availableGovernanceTribute()` functions calculate a user's share by calculating their percentage of the total conviction score to find the amount owed to them.

This is shown in the following statement where `userCS` is the user's conviction score and `totalCS` is the protocol's total conviction score:

    return amount.mul(userCS).div(totalCS);

The tribute amount that can be successfully claimed disproportionally favours users who have updated their conviction score more recently and who are early to claim their allocated tribute.

#### Proof of Concept
Consider the following POC:

*   Two users Alice and Bob both have a conviction score of 5 at time = 1.
*   Time advances such that time = 2.
*   Bob calls `updateConvictionScore()` which sets his conviction score to `5 * time = 10` where time = 2.
*   Therefore, the total conviction score is now 15 and Alice and Bob's individual conviction scores are 5 and 10 respectively.
*   Bob attempts to call `claimTribute()` where the tribute to claim is of size 15 tokens. As a result, Bob receives 10 tokens according to the calculation mentioned above (`(15*10)/15`).
*   Alice updates her conviction score and also attempts to call `claimTribute()`, receiving 7.5 tokens in the process.
*   As a result, a total of 22.5 tokens were transferred out despite the tribute amount being only 15 tokens in total.

As you can see from the above example, the amount of tokens transferred favours user's who claim early and update their conviction score. It is entirely possible that due to the finite amount of tokens stored in the contract, a number of user's won't be able to successfully claim their allocated tribute.

#### Tools Used
Manual code review.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
There is no easy solution to the mentioned issue. Ideally, all users should have an up to date conviction score whenever `claimTribute()` or `claimGovernanceTribute()` are called, although this would be an incredibly gas intensive mitigation. Alternatively, the protocol's total conviction score can be calculated by tracking the total minted balance of `FSD.sol`'s token and multiplying this by a running total of time elapsed. This will need to be adjusted whenever tokens are minted or burned and updated during tribute claims.

## [[M-02] `user.creation` is updated incorrectly when the user tries to extend membership](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[`FSDNetwork.sol` L274-L291](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/20c68793f48ee2678508b9d3a1bae917c007b712/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L274-L291)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/20c68793f48ee2678508b9d3a1bae917c007b712/contracts/network/FSDNetwork.sol#L274-L291>

```js
if (user.creation == 0) {
    user.creation = block.timestamp;
    user.gracePeriod =
        membership[msg.sender].creation +
        MEMBERSHIP_DURATION +
        60 days;
} else {
    uint256 elapsedDurationPercentage = ((block.timestamp -
        user.creation) * 1 ether) / MEMBERSHIP_DURATION;
    if (elapsedDurationPercentage < 1 ether) {
        uint256 durationIncrease = (costShareBenefit.mul(1 ether) /
            (totalCostShareBenefit - costShareBenefit)).mul(
                MEMBERSHIP_DURATION
            ) / 1 ether;
        user.creation += durationIncrease;
        user.gracePeriod += durationIncrease;
    }
}
```

##### PoC
1.  Alice calls `function purchaseMembership()` and adds 20 ether of `costShareBenefit` on day 1:

<!---->

    alice.creation = day 1 timestamp;
    alice.gracePeriod = day 791 timestamp;

2.  Alice calls `function purchaseMembership()` again and adds 20 ether of `costShareBenefit` on day 2:

<!---->

    elapsedDurationPercentage = 1/720
    durationIncrease = 730 day

    alice.creation = day 731 timestamp;
    alice.gracePeriod = day 1521 timestamp;

Making Alice unable to use any membership features until two years later.
