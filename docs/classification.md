# Classification

The ICSE23 paper presented our preliminary investigation, which focused on vulnerability detection tools that were available before August 2022 and capable of analyzing smart contracts before deployment. However, we are now also investigating and recommending tools that work on post-deployment contracts (e.g., [SPCon](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/files/Liu2022FPB.pdf)).

Functional bug classification can be challenging and subjective. Despite our best efforts, there may still be instances where bugs are not classified accurately. We welcome feedback from the community to identify and correct any misclassifications and to help us improve our classification standards.

We are currently in the process of developing our dataset and refining our classification standards. Despite these ongoing updates, the conclusions that we presented in the ICSE23 paper remain consistent as of the time of publication.
