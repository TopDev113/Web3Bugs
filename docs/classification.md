# Classification

The ICSE23 paper presented our preliminary investigation, which focused on vulnerability detection tools that were available before August 2022 and capable of analyzing smart contracts before deployment. However, we are now also investigating and recommending tools that work on post-deployment contracts (e.g., [SPCon](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/files/Liu2022FPB.pdf)).

Our dataset and classification standards are being actively developed, and we welcome contributions from the community to help improve them. Despite these updates, our conclusions, as presented in the ICSE23 paper, remain unchanged.
