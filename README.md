# Demystifying Exploitable Bugs in Smart Contracts

<p>
<a href="papers/icse23.pdf"> <img title="" src="resources/paper.jpg" alt="loading-ag-167" align="right" width="200"></a>

The purpose of this project is to provide a valuable resource for Web3 developers and security analysts by facilitating their understanding of exploitable bugs in smart contracts. We conduct a thorough analysis of exploitable bugs extracted from [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) and classify each bug according to its nature.

Our initial research suggests that current automatic vulnerability detection techniques rely on overly simplistic and generic oracles, such as reentrancy, which may fail to detect functional bugs in smart contracts. We aim to raise awareness about the significance of functional bugs and encourage practitioners to develop more sophisticated and nuanced automatic semantical oracles to detect such bugs.

## Research on Vulnerability Detection with Automatic Semantical Oracles

We plan to compile a comprehensive list of resources that focus on developing semantical oracles for smart contracts. We welcome any additional suggestions or contributions from the community to help expand and improve the list.

+ [AChecker: Statically Detecting Smart Contract Access Control Vulnerabilities](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia/publications/ACheckerICSE2023.pdf), which addresses access control issues.
